# How to provide initial data for models

It’s sometimes useful to prepopulate your database with hard-coded data when
you’re first setting up an app. You can provide initial data with migrations or
fixtures.

## Provide initial data with migrations

To automatically load initial data for an app, create a
[data migration](../topics/migrations.md#data-migrations). Migrations are run when setting up the
test database, so the data will be available there, subject to [some
limitations](../topics/testing/overview.md#test-case-serialized-rollback).

## Provide data with fixtures

You can also provide data using [fixtures](../topics/db/fixtures.md#fixtures-explanation),
however, this data isn’t loaded automatically, except if you use
[`TransactionTestCase.fixtures`](../topics/testing/tools.md#django.test.TransactionTestCase.fixtures).

A fixture is a collection of data that Django knows how to import into a
database. The most straightforward way of creating a fixture if you’ve already
got some data is to use the [`manage.py dumpdata`](../ref/django-admin.md#django-admin-dumpdata) command.
Or, you can write fixtures by hand; fixtures can be written as JSON, XML or YAML
(with [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/) installed) documents. The [serialization documentation](../topics/serialization.md) has more details about each of these supported
[serialization formats](../topics/serialization.md#serialization-formats).

As an example, though, here’s what a fixture for a `Person` model might look
like in JSON:

```js
[
  {
    "model": "myapp.person",
    "pk": 1,
    "fields": {
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Lennon"
    }
  },
  {
    "model": "myapp.person",
    "pk": 2,
    "fields": {
      "first_name": "Paul",
      "last_name": "McCartney"
    }
  }
]
```

And here’s that same fixture as YAML:

```yaml
- model: myapp.person
  pk: 1
  fields:
    first_name: John
    last_name: Lennon
- model: myapp.person
  pk: 2
  fields:
    first_name: Paul
    last_name: McCartney
```

You’ll store this data in a `fixtures` directory inside your app.

You can load data by calling [`manage.py loaddata`](../ref/django-admin.md#django-admin-loaddata)
`<fixturename>`, where `<fixturename>` is the name of the fixture file
you’ve created. Each time you run [`loaddata`](../ref/django-admin.md#django-admin-loaddata), the data will be read
from the fixture and reloaded into the database. Note this means that if you
change one of the rows created by a fixture and then run [`loaddata`](../ref/django-admin.md#django-admin-loaddata)
again, you’ll wipe out any changes you’ve made.

### Tell Django where to look for fixture files

By default, Django looks for fixtures in the `fixtures` directory inside each
app for, so the command `loaddata sample` will find the file
`my_app/fixtures/sample.json`. This works with relative paths as well, so
`loaddata my_app/sample` will find the file
`my_app/fixtures/my_app/sample.json`.

Django also looks for fixtures in the list of directories provided in the
[`FIXTURE_DIRS`](../ref/settings.md#std-setting-FIXTURE_DIRS) setting.

To completely prevent default search form happening, use an absolute path to
specify the location of your fixture file, e.g. `loaddata /path/to/sample`.

Fixtures are also used by the [testing framework](../topics/testing/tools.md#topics-testing-fixtures) to help set up a consistent test environment.
