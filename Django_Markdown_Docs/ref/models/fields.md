# Model field reference

This document contains all the API references of [`Field`](#django.db.models.Field) including the
[field options]() and [field types]() Django offers.

#### SEE ALSO
If the built-in fields don’t do the trick, you can try
[django-localflavor](https://pypi.org/project/django-localflavor/) ([documentation](https://django-localflavor.readthedocs.io/)), which contains assorted
pieces of code that are useful for particular countries and cultures.

Also, you can easily [write your own custom model fields](../../howto/custom-model-fields.md).

#### NOTE
Technically, these models are defined in [`django.db.models.fields`](#module-django.db.models.fields), but
for convenience they’re imported into [`django.db.models`](../../topics/db/models.md#module-django.db.models); the standard
convention is to use `from django.db import models` and refer to fields as
`models.<Foo>Field`.

<a id="common-model-field-options"></a>

## Field options

The following arguments are available to all field types. All are optional.

### `null`

#### Field.null

If `True`, Django will store empty values as `NULL` in the database. Default
is `False`.

Avoid using [`null`](#django.db.models.Field.null) on string-based fields such as
[`CharField`](#django.db.models.CharField) and [`TextField`](#django.db.models.TextField). The Django convention is to use an
empty string, not `NULL`, as the “no data” state for string-based fields. If a
string-based field has `null=False`, empty strings can still be saved for “no
data”. If a string-based field has `null=True`, that means it has two possible
values for “no data”: `NULL`, and the empty string. In most cases, it’s
redundant to have two possible values for “no data”. One exception is when a
[`CharField`](#django.db.models.CharField) has both `unique=True` and `blank=True` set. In this
situation, `null=True` is required to avoid unique constraint violations when
saving multiple objects with blank values.

For both string-based and non-string-based fields, you will also need to
set `blank=True` if you wish to permit empty values in forms, as the
[`null`](#django.db.models.Field.null) parameter only affects database storage
(see [`blank`](#django.db.models.Field.blank)).

#### NOTE
When using the Oracle database backend, the value `NULL` will be stored to
denote the empty string regardless of this attribute.

### `blank`

#### Field.blank

If `True`, the field is allowed to be blank. Default is `False`.

Note that this is different than [`null`](#django.db.models.Field.null). [`null`](#django.db.models.Field.null) is
purely database-related, whereas [`blank`](#django.db.models.Field.blank) is validation-related. If
a field has `blank=True`, form validation will allow entry of an empty value.
If a field has `blank=False`, the field will be required.

<a id="field-choices"></a>

### `choices`

#### Field.choices

A mapping or iterable in the format described below to use as choices for this
field. If choices are given, they’re enforced by
[model validation](instances.md#validating-objects) and the default form widget will
be a select box with these choices instead of the standard text field.

If a mapping is given, the key element is the actual value to be set on the
model, and the second element is the human readable name. For example:

```default
YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES = {
    "FR": "Freshman",
    "SO": "Sophomore",
    "JR": "Junior",
    "SR": "Senior",
    "GR": "Graduate",
}
```

You can also pass a [sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-sequence) consisting itself of iterables of exactly
two items (e.g. `[(A1, B1), (A2, B2), …]`). The first element in each tuple
is the actual value to be set on the model, and the second element is the
human-readable name. For example:

```default
YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES = [
    ("FR", "Freshman"),
    ("SO", "Sophomore"),
    ("JR", "Junior"),
    ("SR", "Senior"),
    ("GR", "Graduate"),
]
```

`choices` can also be defined as a callable that expects no arguments and
returns any of the formats described above. For example:

```default
def get_currencies():
    return {i: i for i in settings.CURRENCIES}


class Expense(models.Model):
    amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    currency = models.CharField(max_length=3, choices=get_currencies)
```

Passing a callable for `choices` can be particularly handy when, for example,
the choices are:

* the result of I/O-bound operations (which could potentially be cached), such
  as querying a table in the same or an external database, or accessing the
  choices from a static file.
* a list that is mostly stable but could vary from time to time or from
  project to project. Examples in this category are using third-party apps that
  provide a well-known inventory of values, such as currencies, countries,
  languages, time zones, etc.

Generally, it’s best to define choices inside a model class, and to
define a suitably-named constant for each value:

```default
from django.db import models


class Student(models.Model):
    FRESHMAN = "FR"
    SOPHOMORE = "SO"
    JUNIOR = "JR"
    SENIOR = "SR"
    GRADUATE = "GR"
    YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES = {
        FRESHMAN: "Freshman",
        SOPHOMORE: "Sophomore",
        JUNIOR: "Junior",
        SENIOR: "Senior",
        GRADUATE: "Graduate",
    }
    year_in_school = models.CharField(
        max_length=2,
        choices=YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES,
        default=FRESHMAN,
    )

    def is_upperclass(self):
        return self.year_in_school in {self.JUNIOR, self.SENIOR}
```

Though you can define a choices list outside of a model class and then
refer to it, defining the choices and names for each choice inside the
model class keeps all of that information with the class that uses it,
and helps reference the choices (e.g, `Student.SOPHOMORE`
will work anywhere that the `Student` model has been imported).

<a id="field-choices-named-groups"></a>

You can also collect your available choices into named groups that can
be used for organizational purposes:

```default
MEDIA_CHOICES = {
    "Audio": {
        "vinyl": "Vinyl",
        "cd": "CD",
    },
    "Video": {
        "vhs": "VHS Tape",
        "dvd": "DVD",
    },
    "unknown": "Unknown",
}
```

The key of the mapping is the name to apply to the group and the value is the
choices inside that group, consisting of the field value and a human-readable
name for an option. Grouped options may be combined with ungrouped options
within a single mapping (such as the `"unknown"` option in this example).

You can also use a sequence, e.g. a list of 2-tuples:

```default
MEDIA_CHOICES = [
    (
        "Audio",
        (
            ("vinyl", "Vinyl"),
            ("cd", "CD"),
        ),
    ),
    (
        "Video",
        (
            ("vhs", "VHS Tape"),
            ("dvd", "DVD"),
        ),
    ),
    ("unknown", "Unknown"),
]
```

Note that choices can be any sequence object – not necessarily a list or
tuple. This lets you construct choices dynamically. But if you find yourself
hacking [`choices`](#django.db.models.Field.choices) to be dynamic, you’re probably better off using
a proper database table with a [`ForeignKey`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey). [`choices`](#django.db.models.Field.choices) is
meant for static data that doesn’t change much, if ever.

#### NOTE
A new migration is created each time the order of `choices` changes.

For each model field that has [`choices`](#django.db.models.Field.choices) set, Django will normalize
the choices to a list of 2-tuples and add a method to retrieve the
human-readable name for the field’s current value. See
[`get_FOO_display()`](instances.md#django.db.models.Model.get_FOO_display) in the database API
documentation.

<a id="field-choices-blank-label"></a>

Unless [`blank=False`](#django.db.models.Field.blank) is set on the field along with a
[`default`](#django.db.models.Field.default) then a label containing `"---------"` will be rendered
with the select box. To override this behavior, add a tuple to `choices`
containing `None`; e.g. `(None, 'Your String For Display')`.
Alternatively, you can use an empty string instead of `None` where this makes
sense - such as on a [`CharField`](#django.db.models.CharField).

<a id="field-choices-enum-types"></a>

#### Enumeration types

In addition, Django provides enumeration types that you can subclass to define
choices in a concise way:

```default
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _


class Student(models.Model):
    class YearInSchool(models.TextChoices):
        FRESHMAN = "FR", _("Freshman")
        SOPHOMORE = "SO", _("Sophomore")
        JUNIOR = "JR", _("Junior")
        SENIOR = "SR", _("Senior")
        GRADUATE = "GR", _("Graduate")

    year_in_school = models.CharField(
        max_length=2,
        choices=YearInSchool,
        default=YearInSchool.FRESHMAN,
    )

    def is_upperclass(self):
        return self.year_in_school in {
            self.YearInSchool.JUNIOR,
            self.YearInSchool.SENIOR,
        }
```

These work similar to [`enum`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#module-enum) from Python’s standard library, but with some
modifications:

* Enum member values are a tuple of arguments to use when constructing the
  concrete data type. Django supports adding an extra string value to the end
  of this tuple to be used as the human-readable name, or `label`. The
  `label` can be a lazy translatable string. Thus, in most cases, the member
  value will be a `(value, label)` 2-tuple. See below for [an example
  of subclassing choices](#field-choices-enum-subclassing) using a more complex
  data type. If a tuple is not provided, or the last item is not a (lazy)
  string, the `label` is [automatically generated](#field-choices-enum-auto-label) from the member name.
* A `.label` property is added on values, to return the human-readable name.
* A number of custom properties are added to the enumeration classes –
  `.choices`, `.labels`, `.values`, and `.names` – to make it easier
  to access lists of those separate parts of the enumeration.

  #### WARNING
  These property names cannot be used as member names as they would conflict.
* The use of [`enum.unique()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#enum.unique) is enforced to ensure that values cannot be
  defined multiple times. This is unlikely to be expected in choices for a
  field.

Note that using `YearInSchool.SENIOR`, `YearInSchool['SENIOR']`, or
`YearInSchool('SR')` to access or lookup enum members work as expected, as do
the `.name` and `.value` properties on the members.

<a id="field-choices-enum-auto-label"></a>

If you don’t need to have the human-readable names translated, you can have
them inferred from the member name (replacing underscores with spaces and using
title-case):

```pycon
>>> class Vehicle(models.TextChoices):
...     CAR = "C"
...     TRUCK = "T"
...     JET_SKI = "J"
...
>>> Vehicle.JET_SKI.label
'Jet Ski'
```

Since the case where the enum values need to be integers is extremely common,
Django provides an `IntegerChoices` class. For example:

```default
class Card(models.Model):
    class Suit(models.IntegerChoices):
        DIAMOND = 1
        SPADE = 2
        HEART = 3
        CLUB = 4

    suit = models.IntegerField(choices=Suit)
```

It is also possible to make use of the [Enum Functional API](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/enum.html#functional-api) with the caveat
that labels are automatically generated as highlighted above:

```pycon
>>> MedalType = models.TextChoices("MedalType", "GOLD SILVER BRONZE")
>>> MedalType.choices
[('GOLD', 'Gold'), ('SILVER', 'Silver'), ('BRONZE', 'Bronze')]
>>> Place = models.IntegerChoices("Place", "FIRST SECOND THIRD")
>>> Place.choices
[(1, 'First'), (2, 'Second'), (3, 'Third')]
```

<a id="field-choices-enum-subclassing"></a>

If you require support for a concrete data type other than `int` or `str`,
you can subclass `Choices` and the required concrete data type, e.g.
[`date`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date) for use with [`DateField`](#django.db.models.DateField):

```default
class MoonLandings(datetime.date, models.Choices):
    APOLLO_11 = 1969, 7, 20, "Apollo 11 (Eagle)"
    APOLLO_12 = 1969, 11, 19, "Apollo 12 (Intrepid)"
    APOLLO_14 = 1971, 2, 5, "Apollo 14 (Antares)"
    APOLLO_15 = 1971, 7, 30, "Apollo 15 (Falcon)"
    APOLLO_16 = 1972, 4, 21, "Apollo 16 (Orion)"
    APOLLO_17 = 1972, 12, 11, "Apollo 17 (Challenger)"
```

There are some additional caveats to be aware of:

- Enumeration types do not support [named groups](#field-choices-named-groups).
- Because an enumeration with a concrete data type requires all values to match
  the type, overriding the [blank label](#field-choices-blank-label)
  cannot be achieved by creating a member with a value of `None`. Instead,
  set the `__empty__` attribute on the class:
  ```default
  class Answer(models.IntegerChoices):
      NO = 0, _("No")
      YES = 1, _("Yes")

      __empty__ = _("(Unknown)")
  ```

### `db_column`

#### Field.db_column

The name of the database column to use for this field. If this isn’t given,
Django will use the field’s name.

If your database column name is an SQL reserved word, or contains
characters that aren’t allowed in Python variable names – notably, the
hyphen – that’s OK. Django quotes column and table names behind the
scenes.

### `db_comment`

#### Field.db_comment

The comment on the database column to use for this field. It is useful for
documenting fields for individuals with direct database access who may not be
looking at your Django code. For example:

```default
pub_date = models.DateTimeField(
    db_comment="Date and time when the article was published",
)
```

### `db_default`

#### Field.db_default

The database-computed default value for this field. This can be a literal value
or a database function, such as [`Now`](database-functions.md#django.db.models.functions.Now):

```default
created = models.DateTimeField(db_default=Now())
```

More complex expressions can be used, as long as they are made from literals
and database functions:

```default
month_due = models.DateField(
    db_default=TruncMonth(
        Now() + timedelta(days=90),
        output_field=models.DateField(),
    )
)
```

Database defaults cannot reference other fields or models. For example, this is
invalid:

```default
end = models.IntegerField(db_default=F("start") + 50)
```

If both `db_default` and [`Field.default`](#django.db.models.Field.default) are set, `default` will take
precedence when creating instances in Python code. `db_default` will still be
set at the database level and will be used when inserting rows outside of the
ORM or when adding a new field in a migration.

### `db_index`

#### Field.db_index

If `True`, a database index will be created for this field.

### `db_tablespace`

#### Field.db_tablespace

The name of the [database tablespace](../../topics/db/tablespaces.md) to use for
this field’s index, if this field is indexed. The default is the project’s
[`DEFAULT_INDEX_TABLESPACE`](../settings.md#std-setting-DEFAULT_INDEX_TABLESPACE) setting, if set, or the
[`db_tablespace`](options.md#django.db.models.Options.db_tablespace) of the model, if any. If the backend doesn’t
support tablespaces for indexes, this option is ignored.

### `default`

#### Field.default

The default value for the field. This can be a value or a callable object. If
callable it will be called every time a new object is created.

The default can’t be a mutable object (model instance, `list`, `set`, etc.),
as a reference to the same instance of that object would be used as the default
value in all new model instances. Instead, wrap the desired default in a
callable. For example, if you want to specify a default `dict` for
[`JSONField`](#django.db.models.JSONField), use a function:

```default
def contact_default():
    return {"email": "to1@example.com"}


contact_info = JSONField("ContactInfo", default=contact_default)
```

`lambda`s can’t be used for field options like `default` because they
can’t be [serialized by migrations](../../topics/migrations.md#migration-serializing). See that
documentation for other caveats.

For fields like [`ForeignKey`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey) that map to model instances, defaults
should be the value of the field they reference (`pk` unless
[`to_field`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey.to_field) is set) instead of model instances.

The default value is used when new model instances are created and a value
isn’t provided for the field. When the field is a primary key, the default is
also used when the field is set to `None`.

The default value can also be set at the database level with
[`Field.db_default`](#django.db.models.Field.db_default).

### `editable`

#### Field.editable

If `False`, the field will not be displayed in the admin or any other
[`ModelForm`](../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#django.forms.ModelForm). They are also skipped during [model
validation](instances.md#validating-objects). Default is `True`.

### `error_messages`

#### Field.error_messages

The `error_messages` argument lets you override the default messages that the
field will raise. Pass in a dictionary with keys matching the error messages you
want to override.

Error message keys include `null`, `blank`, `invalid`, `invalid_choice`,
`unique`, and `unique_for_date`. Additional error message keys are
specified for each field in the [Field types]() section below.

These error messages often don’t propagate to forms. See
[Considerations regarding model’s error_messages](../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#considerations-regarding-model-errormessages).

### `help_text`

#### Field.help_text

Extra “help” text to be displayed with the form widget. It’s useful for
documentation even if your field isn’t used on a form.

Note that this value is *not* HTML-escaped in automatically-generated
forms. This lets you include HTML in [`help_text`](#django.db.models.Field.help_text) if you so
desire. For example:

```default
help_text = "Please use the following format: <em>YYYY-MM-DD</em>."
```

Alternatively you can use plain text and
[`django.utils.html.escape()`](../utils.md#django.utils.html.escape) to escape any HTML special characters. Ensure
that you escape any help text that may come from untrusted users to avoid a
cross-site scripting attack.

### `primary_key`

#### Field.primary_key

If `True`, this field is the primary key for the model.

If you don’t specify `primary_key=True` for any field in your model, Django
will automatically add a field to hold the primary key, so you don’t need to
set `primary_key=True` on any of your fields unless you want to override the
default primary-key behavior. The type of auto-created primary key fields can
be specified per app in [`AppConfig.default_auto_field`](../applications.md#django.apps.AppConfig.default_auto_field) or globally in the
[`DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`](../settings.md#std-setting-DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD) setting. For more, see
[Automatic primary key fields](../../topics/db/models.md#automatic-primary-key-fields).

`primary_key=True` implies [`null=False`](#django.db.models.Field.null) and
[`unique=True`](#django.db.models.Field.unique). Only one primary key is allowed on an
object.

The primary key field is read-only. If you change the value of the primary
key on an existing object and then save it, a new object will be created
alongside the old one.

The primary key field is set to `None` when
[`deleting`](instances.md#django.db.models.Model.delete) an object.

### `unique`

#### Field.unique

If `True`, this field must be unique throughout the table.

This is enforced at the database level and by model validation. If
you try to save a model with a duplicate value in a [`unique`](#django.db.models.Field.unique)
field, a [`django.db.IntegrityError`](../exceptions.md#django.db.IntegrityError) will be raised by the model’s
[`save()`](instances.md#django.db.models.Model.save) method.

This option is valid on all field types except [`ManyToManyField`](#django.db.models.ManyToManyField) and
[`OneToOneField`](#django.db.models.OneToOneField).

Note that when `unique` is `True`, you don’t need to specify
[`db_index`](#django.db.models.Field.db_index), because `unique` implies the creation of an index.

### `unique_for_date`

#### Field.unique_for_date

Set this to the name of a [`DateField`](#django.db.models.DateField) or [`DateTimeField`](#django.db.models.DateTimeField) to
require that this field be unique for the value of the date field.

For example, if you have a field `title` that has
`unique_for_date="pub_date"`, then Django wouldn’t allow the entry of two
records with the same `title` and `pub_date`.

Note that if you set this to point to a [`DateTimeField`](#django.db.models.DateTimeField), only the date
portion of the field will be considered. Besides, when [`USE_TZ`](../settings.md#std-setting-USE_TZ) is
`True`, the check will be performed in the [current time zone](../../topics/i18n/timezones.md#default-current-time-zone) at the time the object gets saved.

This is enforced by [`Model.validate_unique()`](instances.md#django.db.models.Model.validate_unique) during model validation
but not at the database level. If any [`unique_for_date`](#django.db.models.Field.unique_for_date) constraint
involves fields that are not part of a [`ModelForm`](../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#django.forms.ModelForm) (for
example, if one of the fields is listed in `exclude` or has
[`editable=False`](#django.db.models.Field.editable)), [`Model.validate_unique()`](instances.md#django.db.models.Model.validate_unique) will
skip validation for that particular constraint.

### `unique_for_month`

#### Field.unique_for_month

Like [`unique_for_date`](#django.db.models.Field.unique_for_date), but requires the field to be unique with
respect to the month.

### `unique_for_year`

#### Field.unique_for_year

Like [`unique_for_date`](#django.db.models.Field.unique_for_date) and [`unique_for_month`](#django.db.models.Field.unique_for_month).

### `verbose_name`

#### Field.verbose_name

A human-readable name for the field. If the verbose name isn’t given, Django
will automatically create it using the field’s attribute name, converting
underscores to spaces. See [Verbose field names](../../topics/db/models.md#verbose-field-names).

### `validators`

#### Field.validators

A list of validators to run for this field. See the [validators
documentation](../validators.md) for more information.

<a id="model-field-types"></a>

## Field types

### `AutoField`

### *class* AutoField(\*\*options)

An [`IntegerField`](#django.db.models.IntegerField) that automatically increments
according to available IDs. You usually won’t need to use this directly; a
primary key field will automatically be added to your model if you don’t specify
otherwise. See [Automatic primary key fields](../../topics/db/models.md#automatic-primary-key-fields).

### `BigAutoField`

### *class* BigAutoField(\*\*options)

A 64-bit integer, much like an [`AutoField`](#django.db.models.AutoField) except that it is
guaranteed to fit numbers from `1` to `9223372036854775807`.

### `BigIntegerField`

### *class* BigIntegerField(\*\*options)

A 64-bit integer, much like an [`IntegerField`](#django.db.models.IntegerField) except that it is
guaranteed to fit numbers from `-9223372036854775808` to
`9223372036854775807`. The default form widget for this field is a
[`NumberInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.NumberInput).

### `BinaryField`

### *class* BinaryField(max_length=None, \*\*options)

A field to store raw binary data. It can be assigned [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes),
[`bytearray`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray), or [`memoryview`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview).

By default, `BinaryField` sets [`editable`](#django.db.models.Field.editable) to `False`, in which
case it can’t be included in a [`ModelForm`](../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#django.forms.ModelForm).

#### BinaryField.max_length

Optional. The maximum length (in bytes) of the field. The maximum length is
enforced in Django’s validation using
[`MaxLengthValidator`](../validators.md#django.core.validators.MaxLengthValidator).

### `BooleanField`

### *class* BooleanField(\*\*options)

A true/false field.

The default form widget for this field is [`CheckboxInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.CheckboxInput),
or [`NullBooleanSelect`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.NullBooleanSelect) if [`null=True`](#django.db.models.Field.null).

The default value of `BooleanField` is `None` when [`Field.default`](#django.db.models.Field.default)
isn’t defined.

### `CharField`

### *class* CharField(max_length=None, \*\*options)

A string field, for small- to large-sized strings.

For large amounts of text, use [`TextField`](#django.db.models.TextField).

The default form widget for this field is a [`TextInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.TextInput).

[`CharField`](#django.db.models.CharField) has the following extra arguments:

#### CharField.max_length

The maximum length (in characters) of the field. The `max_length`
is enforced at the database level and in Django’s validation using
[`MaxLengthValidator`](../validators.md#django.core.validators.MaxLengthValidator). It’s required for all
database backends included with Django except PostgreSQL, which supports
unlimited `VARCHAR` columns.

#### NOTE
If you are writing an application that must be portable to multiple
database backends, you should be aware that there are restrictions on
`max_length` for some backends. Refer to the [database backend
notes](../databases.md) for details.

#### CharField.db_collation

Optional. The database collation name of the field.

#### NOTE
Collation names are not standardized. As such, this will not be
portable across multiple database backends.

### `DateField`

### *class* DateField(auto_now=False, auto_now_add=False, \*\*options)

A date, represented in Python by a `datetime.date` instance. Has a few extra,
optional arguments:

#### DateField.auto_now

Automatically set the field to now every time the object is saved. Useful
for “last-modified” timestamps. Note that the current date is *always*
used; it’s not just a default value that you can override.

The field is only automatically updated when calling [`Model.save()`](instances.md#django.db.models.Model.save). The field isn’t updated when making updates
to other fields in other ways such as [`QuerySet.update()`](querysets.md#django.db.models.query.QuerySet.update), though you can specify a custom
value for the field in an update like that.

#### DateField.auto_now_add

Automatically set the field to now when the object is first created. Useful
for creation of timestamps. Note that the current date is *always* used;
it’s not just a default value that you can override. So even if you
set a value for this field when creating the object, it will be ignored.
If you want to be able to modify this field, set the following instead of
`auto_now_add=True`:

* For [`DateField`](#django.db.models.DateField): `default=date.today` - from
  [`datetime.date.today()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.today)
* For [`DateTimeField`](#django.db.models.DateTimeField): `default=timezone.now` - from
  [`django.utils.timezone.now()`](../utils.md#django.utils.timezone.now)

The default form widget for this field is a
[`DateInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.DateInput). The admin adds a JavaScript calendar,
and a shortcut for “Today”. Includes an additional `invalid_date` error
message key.

The options `auto_now_add`, `auto_now`, and `default` are mutually exclusive.
Any combination of these options will result in an error.

#### NOTE
As currently implemented, setting `auto_now` or `auto_now_add` to
`True` will cause the field to have `editable=False` and `blank=True`
set.

#### NOTE
The `auto_now` and `auto_now_add` options will always use the date in
the [default timezone](../../topics/i18n/timezones.md#default-current-time-zone) at the moment of
creation or update. If you need something different, you may want to
consider using your own callable default or overriding `save()` instead
of using `auto_now` or `auto_now_add`; or using a `DateTimeField`
instead of a `DateField` and deciding how to handle the conversion from
datetime to date at display time.

#### WARNING
Always use [`DateField`](#django.db.models.DateField) with a `datetime.date` instance.

If you have a `datetime.datetime` instance, it’s recommended to convert
it to a `datetime.date` first. If you don’t, [`DateField`](#django.db.models.DateField) will
localize the `datetime.datetime` to the [default timezone](../../topics/i18n/timezones.md#default-current-time-zone) and convert it to a `datetime.date`
instance, removing its time component. This is true for both storage and
comparison.

### `DateTimeField`

### *class* DateTimeField(auto_now=False, auto_now_add=False, \*\*options)

A date and time, represented in Python by a `datetime.datetime` instance.
Takes the same extra arguments as [`DateField`](#django.db.models.DateField).

The default form widget for this field is a single
[`DateTimeInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.DateTimeInput). The admin uses two separate
[`TextInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.TextInput) widgets with JavaScript shortcuts.

#### WARNING
Always use [`DateTimeField`](#django.db.models.DateTimeField) with a `datetime.datetime`
instance.

If you have a `datetime.date` instance, it’s recommended to convert it to
a `datetime.datetime` first. If you don’t, [`DateTimeField`](#django.db.models.DateTimeField) will
use midnight in the [default timezone](../../topics/i18n/timezones.md#default-current-time-zone) for
the time component. This is true for both storage and comparison. To
compare the date portion of a [`DateTimeField`](#django.db.models.DateTimeField) with a
`datetime.date` instance, use the [`date`](querysets.md#std-fieldlookup-date) lookup.

### `DecimalField`

### *class* DecimalField(max_digits=None, decimal_places=None, \*\*options)

A fixed-precision decimal number, represented in Python by a
[`Decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal) instance. It validates the input using
[`DecimalValidator`](../validators.md#django.core.validators.DecimalValidator).

Has the following **required** arguments:

#### DecimalField.max_digits

The maximum number of digits allowed in the number. Note that this number
must be greater than or equal to `decimal_places`.

#### DecimalField.decimal_places

The number of decimal places to store with the number.

For example, to store numbers up to `999.99` with a resolution of 2 decimal
places, you’d use:

```default
models.DecimalField(..., max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)
```

And to store numbers up to approximately one billion with a resolution of 10
decimal places:

```default
models.DecimalField(..., max_digits=19, decimal_places=10)
```

The default form widget for this field is a [`NumberInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.NumberInput)
when [`localize`](../forms/fields.md#django.forms.Field.localize) is `False` or
[`TextInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.TextInput) otherwise.

#### NOTE
For more information about the differences between the
[`FloatField`](#django.db.models.FloatField) and [`DecimalField`](#django.db.models.DecimalField) classes, please
see [FloatField vs. DecimalField](#floatfield-vs-decimalfield). You
should also be aware of [SQLite limitations](../databases.md#sqlite-decimal-handling)
of decimal fields.

### `DurationField`

### *class* DurationField(\*\*options)

A field for storing periods of time - modeled in Python by
[`timedelta`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timedelta). When used on PostgreSQL, the data type
used is an `interval` and on Oracle the data type is `INTERVAL DAY(9) TO
SECOND(6)`. Otherwise a `bigint` of microseconds is used.

#### NOTE
Arithmetic with `DurationField` works in most cases. However on all
databases other than PostgreSQL, comparing the value of a `DurationField`
to arithmetic on `DateTimeField` instances will not work as expected.

### `EmailField`

### *class* EmailField(max_length=254, \*\*options)

A [`CharField`](#django.db.models.CharField) that checks that the value is a valid email address using
[`EmailValidator`](../validators.md#django.core.validators.EmailValidator).

### `FileField`

### *class* FileField(upload_to='', storage=None, max_length=100, \*\*options)

A file-upload field.

#### NOTE
The `primary_key` argument isn’t supported and will raise an error if
used.

Has the following optional arguments:

#### FileField.upload_to

This attribute provides a way of setting the upload directory and file name,
and can be set in two ways. In both cases, the value is passed to the
[`Storage.save()`](../files/storage.md#django.core.files.storage.Storage.save) method.

If you specify a string value or a [`Path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path), it may contain
[`strftime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strftime) formatting, which will be replaced by the date/time
of the file upload (so that uploaded files don’t fill up the given
directory). For example:

```default
class MyModel(models.Model):
    # file will be uploaded to MEDIA_ROOT/uploads
    upload = models.FileField(upload_to="uploads/")
    # or...
    # file will be saved to MEDIA_ROOT/uploads/2015/01/30
    upload = models.FileField(upload_to="uploads/%Y/%m/%d/")
```

If you are using the default
[`FileSystemStorage`](../files/storage.md#django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage), the string value
will be appended to your [`MEDIA_ROOT`](../settings.md#std-setting-MEDIA_ROOT) path to form the location on
the local filesystem where uploaded files will be stored. If you are using
a different storage, check that storage’s documentation to see how it
handles `upload_to`.

`upload_to` may also be a callable, such as a function. This will be
called to obtain the upload path, including the filename. This callable must
accept two arguments and return a Unix-style path (with forward slashes)
to be passed along to the storage system. The two arguments are:

| Argument   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `instance` | An instance of the model where the<br/>`FileField` is defined. More specifically,<br/>this is the particular instance where the<br/>current file is being attached.<br/><br/>In most cases, this object will not have been<br/>saved to the database yet, so if it uses the<br/>default `AutoField`, *it might not yet have a<br/>value for its primary key field*. |
| `filename` | The filename that was originally given to the<br/>file. This may or may not be taken into account<br/>when determining the final destination path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

For example:

```default
def user_directory_path(instance, filename):
    # file will be uploaded to MEDIA_ROOT/user_<id>/<filename>
    return "user_{0}/{1}".format(instance.user.id, filename)


class MyModel(models.Model):
    upload = models.FileField(upload_to=user_directory_path)
```

#### FileField.storage

A storage object, or a callable which returns a storage object. This
handles the storage and retrieval of your files. See [Managing files](../../topics/files.md)
for details on how to provide this object.

The default form widget for this field is a
[`ClearableFileInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.ClearableFileInput).

Using a [`FileField`](#django.db.models.FileField) or an [`ImageField`](#django.db.models.ImageField) (see below) in a model
takes a few steps:

1. In your settings file, you’ll need to define [`MEDIA_ROOT`](../settings.md#std-setting-MEDIA_ROOT) as the
   full path to a directory where you’d like Django to store uploaded files.
   (For performance, these files are not stored in the database.) Define
   [`MEDIA_URL`](../settings.md#std-setting-MEDIA_URL) as the base public URL of that directory. Make sure
   that this directory is writable by the web server’s user account.
2. Add the [`FileField`](#django.db.models.FileField) or [`ImageField`](#django.db.models.ImageField) to your model, defining
   the [`upload_to`](#django.db.models.FileField.upload_to) option to specify a subdirectory of
   [`MEDIA_ROOT`](../settings.md#std-setting-MEDIA_ROOT) to use for uploaded files.
3. All that will be stored in your database is a path to the file
   (relative to [`MEDIA_ROOT`](../settings.md#std-setting-MEDIA_ROOT)). You’ll most likely want to use the
   convenience [`url`](#django.db.models.fields.files.FieldFile.url) attribute
   provided by Django. For example, if your [`ImageField`](#django.db.models.ImageField) is called
   `mug_shot`, you can get the absolute path to your image in a template with
   `{{ object.mug_shot.url }}`.

For example, say your [`MEDIA_ROOT`](../settings.md#std-setting-MEDIA_ROOT) is set to `'/home/media'`, and
[`upload_to`](#django.db.models.FileField.upload_to) is set to `'photos/%Y/%m/%d'`. The `'%Y/%m/%d'`
part of [`upload_to`](#django.db.models.FileField.upload_to) is [`strftime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strftime) formatting;
`'%Y'` is the four-digit year, `'%m'` is the two-digit month and `'%d'` is
the two-digit day. If you upload a file on Jan. 15, 2007, it will be saved in
the directory `/home/media/photos/2007/01/15`.

If you wanted to retrieve the uploaded file’s on-disk filename, or the file’s
size, you could use the [`name`](../files/file.md#django.core.files.File.name) and
[`size`](../files/file.md#django.core.files.File.size) attributes respectively; for more
information on the available attributes and methods, see the
[`File`](../files/file.md#django.core.files.File) class reference and the [Managing files](../../topics/files.md)
topic guide.

#### NOTE
The file is saved as part of saving the model in the database, so the actual
file name used on disk cannot be relied on until after the model has been
saved.

The uploaded file’s relative URL can be obtained using the
[`url`](#django.db.models.fields.files.FieldFile.url) attribute. Internally,
this calls the [`url()`](../files/storage.md#django.core.files.storage.Storage.url) method of the
underlying [`Storage`](../files/storage.md#django.core.files.storage.Storage) class.

<a id="file-upload-security"></a>

Note that whenever you deal with uploaded files, you should pay close attention
to where you’re uploading them and what type of files they are, to avoid
security holes. *Validate all uploaded files* so that you’re sure the files are
what you think they are. For example, if you blindly let somebody upload files,
without validation, to a directory that’s within your web server’s document
root, then somebody could upload a CGI or PHP script and execute that script by
visiting its URL on your site. Don’t allow that.

Also note that even an uploaded HTML file, since it can be executed by the
browser (though not by the server), can pose security threats that are
equivalent to XSS or CSRF attacks.

[`FileField`](#django.db.models.FileField) instances are created in your database as `varchar`
columns with a default max length of 100 characters. As with other fields, you
can change the maximum length using the [`max_length`](#django.db.models.CharField.max_length) argument.

#### `FileField` and `FieldFile`

### *class* FieldFile

When you access a [`FileField`](#django.db.models.FileField) on a model, you are
given an instance of [`FieldFile`](#django.db.models.fields.files.FieldFile) as a proxy for accessing the underlying
file.

The API of [`FieldFile`](#django.db.models.fields.files.FieldFile) mirrors that of [`File`](../files/file.md#django.core.files.File),
with one key difference: *The object wrapped by the class is not necessarily a
wrapper around Python’s built-in file object.* Instead, it is a wrapper around
the result of the [`Storage.open()`](../files/storage.md#django.core.files.storage.Storage.open)
method, which may be a [`File`](../files/file.md#django.core.files.File) object, or it may be a
custom storage’s implementation of the [`File`](../files/file.md#django.core.files.File) API.

In addition to the API inherited from [`File`](../files/file.md#django.core.files.File) such as
`read()` and `write()`, [`FieldFile`](#django.db.models.fields.files.FieldFile) includes several methods that
can be used to interact with the underlying file:

#### WARNING
Two methods of this class, [`save()`](#django.db.models.fields.files.FieldFile.save) and
[`delete()`](#django.db.models.fields.files.FieldFile.delete), default to saving the model object of the
associated `FieldFile` in the database.

#### FieldFile.name

The name of the file including the relative path from the root of the
[`Storage`](../files/storage.md#django.core.files.storage.Storage) of the associated
[`FileField`](#django.db.models.FileField).

#### FieldFile.path

A read-only property to access the file’s local filesystem path by calling the
[`path()`](../files/storage.md#django.core.files.storage.Storage.path) method of the underlying
[`Storage`](../files/storage.md#django.core.files.storage.Storage) class.

#### FieldFile.size

The result of the underlying [`Storage.size()`](../files/storage.md#django.core.files.storage.Storage.size) method.

#### FieldFile.url

A read-only property to access the file’s relative URL by calling the
[`url()`](../files/storage.md#django.core.files.storage.Storage.url) method of the underlying
[`Storage`](../files/storage.md#django.core.files.storage.Storage) class.

#### FieldFile.open(mode='rb')

Opens or reopens the file associated with this instance in the specified
`mode`. Unlike the standard Python `open()` method, it doesn’t return a
file descriptor.

Since the underlying file is opened implicitly when accessing it, it may be
unnecessary to call this method except to reset the pointer to the underlying
file or to change the `mode`.

#### FieldFile.close()

Behaves like the standard Python `file.close()` method and closes the file
associated with this instance.

#### FieldFile.save(name, content, save=True)

This method takes a filename and file contents and passes them to the storage
class for the field, then associates the stored file with the model field.
If you want to manually associate file data with
[`FileField`](#django.db.models.FileField) instances on your model, the `save()`
method is used to persist that file data.

Takes two required arguments: `name` which is the name of the file, and
`content` which is an object containing the file’s contents.  The
optional `save` argument controls whether or not the model instance is
saved after the file associated with this field has been altered. Defaults to
`True`.

Note that the `content` argument should be an instance of
[`django.core.files.File`](../files/file.md#django.core.files.File), not Python’s built-in file object.
You can construct a [`File`](../files/file.md#django.core.files.File) from an existing
Python file object like this:

```default
from django.core.files import File

# Open an existing file using Python's built-in open()
f = open("/path/to/hello.world")
myfile = File(f)
```

Or you can construct one from a Python string like this:

```default
from django.core.files.base import ContentFile

myfile = ContentFile("hello world")
```

For more information, see [Managing files](../../topics/files.md).

#### FieldFile.delete(save=True)

Deletes the file associated with this instance and clears all attributes on
the field. Note: This method will close the file if it happens to be open when
`delete()` is called.

The optional `save` argument controls whether or not the model instance is
saved after the file associated with this field has been deleted. Defaults to
`True`.

Note that when a model is deleted, related files are not deleted. If you need
to cleanup orphaned files, you’ll need to handle it yourself (for instance,
with a custom management command that can be run manually or scheduled to run
periodically via e.g. cron).

### `FilePathField`

### *class* FilePathField(path='', match=None, recursive=False, allow_files=True, allow_folders=False, max_length=100, \*\*options)

A [`CharField`](#django.db.models.CharField) whose choices are limited to the filenames in a certain
directory on the filesystem. Has some special arguments, of which the first is
**required**:

#### FilePathField.path

Required. The absolute filesystem path to a directory from which this
[`FilePathField`](#django.db.models.FilePathField) should get its choices. Example: `"/home/images"`.

`path` may also be a callable, such as a function to dynamically set the
path at runtime. Example:

```default
import os
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models


def images_path():
    return os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, "images")


class MyModel(models.Model):
    file = models.FilePathField(path=images_path)
```

#### FilePathField.match

Optional. A regular expression, as a string, that [`FilePathField`](#django.db.models.FilePathField)
will use to filter filenames. Note that the regex will be applied to the
base filename, not the full path. Example: `"foo.*\.txt$"`, which will
match a file called `foo23.txt` but not `bar.txt` or `foo23.png`.

#### FilePathField.recursive

Optional. Either `True` or `False`. Default is `False`. Specifies
whether all subdirectories of [`path`](#django.db.models.FilePathField.path) should be included

#### FilePathField.allow_files

Optional.  Either `True` or `False`.  Default is `True`.  Specifies
whether files in the specified location should be included.  Either this or
[`allow_folders`](#django.db.models.FilePathField.allow_folders) must be `True`.

#### FilePathField.allow_folders

Optional.  Either `True` or `False`.  Default is `False`.  Specifies
whether folders in the specified location should be included.  Either this
or [`allow_files`](#django.db.models.FilePathField.allow_files) must be `True`.

The one potential gotcha is that [`match`](#django.db.models.FilePathField.match) applies to the
base filename, not the full path. So, this example:

```default
FilePathField(path="/home/images", match="foo.*", recursive=True)
```

…will match `/home/images/foo.png` but not `/home/images/foo/bar.png`
because the [`match`](#django.db.models.FilePathField.match) applies to the base filename
(`foo.png` and `bar.png`).

[`FilePathField`](#django.db.models.FilePathField) instances are created in your database as `varchar`
columns with a default max length of 100 characters. As with other fields, you
can change the maximum length using the [`max_length`](#django.db.models.CharField.max_length) argument.

### `FloatField`

### *class* FloatField(\*\*options)

A floating-point number represented in Python by a `float` instance.

The default form widget for this field is a [`NumberInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.NumberInput)
when [`localize`](../forms/fields.md#django.forms.Field.localize) is `False` or
[`TextInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.TextInput) otherwise.

<a id="floatfield-vs-decimalfield"></a>

### `GeneratedField`

### *class* GeneratedField(expression, output_field, db_persist=None, \*\*kwargs)

A field that is always computed based on other fields in the model. This field
is managed and updated by the database itself. Uses the `GENERATED ALWAYS`
SQL syntax.

There are two kinds of generated columns: stored and virtual. A stored
generated column is computed when it is written (inserted or updated) and
occupies storage as if it were a regular column. A virtual generated column
occupies no storage and is computed when it is read. Thus, a virtual generated
column is similar to a view and a stored generated column is similar to a
materialized view.

#### GeneratedField.expression

An [`Expression`](expressions.md#django.db.models.Expression) used by the database to automatically set the field
value each time the model is changed.

The expressions should be deterministic and only reference fields within
the model (in the same database table). Generated fields cannot reference
other generated fields. Database backends can impose further restrictions.

#### GeneratedField.output_field

A model field instance to define the field’s data type.

#### GeneratedField.db_persist

Determines if the database column should occupy storage as if it were a
real column. If `False`, the column acts as a virtual column and does
not occupy database storage space.

PostgreSQL only supports persisted columns. Oracle only supports virtual
columns.

### `GenericIPAddressField`

### *class* GenericIPAddressField(protocol='both', unpack_ipv4=False, \*\*options)

An IPv4 or IPv6 address, in string format (e.g. `192.0.2.30` or
`2a02:42fe::4`). The default form widget for this field is a
[`TextInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.TextInput).

The IPv6 address normalization follows [**RFC 4291#section-2.2**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291.html#section-2.2) section 2.2,
including using the IPv4 format suggested in paragraph 3 of that section, like
`::ffff:192.0.2.0`. For example, `2001:0::0:01` would be normalized to
`2001::1`, and `::ffff:0a0a:0a0a` to `::ffff:10.10.10.10`. All characters
are converted to lowercase.

#### GenericIPAddressField.protocol

Limits valid inputs to the specified protocol.
Accepted values are `'both'` (default), `'IPv4'`
or `'IPv6'`. Matching is case insensitive.

#### GenericIPAddressField.unpack_ipv4

Unpacks IPv4 mapped addresses like `::ffff:192.0.2.1`.
If this option is enabled that address would be unpacked to
`192.0.2.1`. Default is disabled. Can only be used
when `protocol` is set to `'both'`.

If you allow for blank values, you have to allow for null values since blank
values are stored as null.

### `ImageField`

### *class* ImageField(upload_to=None, height_field=None, width_field=None, max_length=100, \*\*options)

Inherits all attributes and methods from [`FileField`](#django.db.models.FileField), but also
validates that the uploaded object is a valid image.

In addition to the special attributes that are available for [`FileField`](#django.db.models.FileField),
an [`ImageField`](#django.db.models.ImageField) also has `height` and `width` attributes.

To facilitate querying on those attributes, [`ImageField`](#django.db.models.ImageField) has the
following optional arguments:

#### ImageField.height_field

Name of a model field which is auto-populated with the height of the image
each time an image object is set.

#### ImageField.width_field

Name of a model field which is auto-populated with the width of the image
each time an image object is set.

Requires the [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/) library.

[`ImageField`](#django.db.models.ImageField) instances are created in your database as `varchar`
columns with a default max length of 100 characters. As with other fields, you
can change the maximum length using the [`max_length`](#django.db.models.CharField.max_length) argument.

The default form widget for this field is a
[`ClearableFileInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.ClearableFileInput).

### `IntegerField`

### *class* IntegerField(\*\*options)

An integer. Values from `-2147483648` to `2147483647` are safe in all
databases supported by Django.

It uses [`MinValueValidator`](../validators.md#django.core.validators.MinValueValidator) and
[`MaxValueValidator`](../validators.md#django.core.validators.MaxValueValidator) to validate the input based
on the values that the default database supports.

The default form widget for this field is a [`NumberInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.NumberInput)
when [`localize`](../forms/fields.md#django.forms.Field.localize) is `False` or
[`TextInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.TextInput) otherwise.

### `JSONField`

### *class* JSONField(encoder=None, decoder=None, \*\*options)

A field for storing JSON encoded data. In Python the data is represented in its
Python native format: dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers, booleans and
`None`.

`JSONField` is supported on MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQLite
(with the [JSON1 extension enabled](../databases.md#sqlite-json1)).

#### JSONField.encoder

An optional [`json.JSONEncoder`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.JSONEncoder) subclass to serialize data types
not supported by the standard JSON serializer (e.g. `datetime.datetime`
or [`UUID`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html#uuid.UUID)). For example, you can use the
[`DjangoJSONEncoder`](../../topics/serialization.md#django.core.serializers.json.DjangoJSONEncoder) class.

Defaults to `json.JSONEncoder`.

#### JSONField.decoder

An optional [`json.JSONDecoder`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.JSONDecoder) subclass to deserialize the value
retrieved from the database. The value will be in the format chosen by the
custom encoder (most often a string). Your deserialization may need to
account for the fact that you can’t be certain of the input type. For
example, you run the risk of returning a `datetime` that was actually a
string that just happened to be in the same format chosen for
`datetime`s.

Defaults to `json.JSONDecoder`.

To query `JSONField` in the database, see [Querying JSONField](../../topics/db/queries.md#querying-jsonfield).

### `PositiveBigIntegerField`

### *class* PositiveBigIntegerField(\*\*options)

Like a [`PositiveIntegerField`](#django.db.models.PositiveIntegerField), but only allows values under a certain
(database-dependent) point. Values from `0` to `9223372036854775807` are
safe in all databases supported by Django.

### `PositiveIntegerField`

### *class* PositiveIntegerField(\*\*options)

Like an [`IntegerField`](#django.db.models.IntegerField), but must be either positive or zero (`0`).
Values from `0` to `2147483647` are safe in all databases supported by
Django. The value `0` is accepted for backward compatibility reasons.

### `PositiveSmallIntegerField`

### *class* PositiveSmallIntegerField(\*\*options)

Like a [`PositiveIntegerField`](#django.db.models.PositiveIntegerField), but only allows values under a certain
(database-dependent) point. Values from `0` to `32767` are safe in all
databases supported by Django.

### `SlugField`

### *class* SlugField(max_length=50, \*\*options)

[Slug](../../glossary.md#term-slug) is a newspaper term. A slug is a short label for something,
containing only letters, numbers, underscores or hyphens. They’re generally used
in URLs.

Like a CharField, you can specify [`max_length`](#django.db.models.CharField.max_length) (read the note
about database portability and [`max_length`](#django.db.models.CharField.max_length) in that section,
too). If [`max_length`](#django.db.models.CharField.max_length) is not specified, Django will use a
default length of 50.

Implies setting [`Field.db_index`](#django.db.models.Field.db_index) to `True`.

It is often useful to automatically prepopulate a SlugField based on the value
of some other value.  You can do this automatically in the admin using
[`prepopulated_fields`](../contrib/admin/index.md#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.prepopulated_fields).

It uses [`validate_slug`](../validators.md#django.core.validators.validate_slug) or
[`validate_unicode_slug`](../validators.md#django.core.validators.validate_unicode_slug) for validation.

#### SlugField.allow_unicode

If `True`, the field accepts Unicode letters in addition to ASCII
letters. Defaults to `False`.

### `SmallAutoField`

### *class* SmallAutoField(\*\*options)

Like an [`AutoField`](#django.db.models.AutoField), but only allows values under a certain
(database-dependent) limit. Values from `1` to `32767` are safe in all
databases supported by Django.

### `SmallIntegerField`

### *class* SmallIntegerField(\*\*options)

Like an [`IntegerField`](#django.db.models.IntegerField), but only allows values under a certain
(database-dependent) point. Values from `-32768` to `32767` are safe in all
databases supported by Django.

### `TextField`

### *class* TextField(\*\*options)

A large text field. The default form widget for this field is a
[`Textarea`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.Textarea).

If you specify a `max_length` attribute, it will be reflected in the
[`Textarea`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.Textarea) widget of the auto-generated form field.
However it is not enforced at the model or database level. Use a
[`CharField`](#django.db.models.CharField) for that.

#### TextField.db_collation

Optional. The database collation name of the field.

#### NOTE
Collation names are not standardized. As such, this will not be
portable across multiple database backends.

### `TimeField`

### *class* TimeField(auto_now=False, auto_now_add=False, \*\*options)

A time, represented in Python by a `datetime.time` instance. Accepts the same
auto-population options as [`DateField`](#django.db.models.DateField).

The default form widget for this field is a [`TimeInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.TimeInput).
The admin adds some JavaScript shortcuts.

### `URLField`

### *class* URLField(max_length=200, \*\*options)

A [`CharField`](#django.db.models.CharField) for a URL, validated by
[`URLValidator`](../validators.md#django.core.validators.URLValidator).

The default form widget for this field is a [`URLInput`](../forms/widgets.md#django.forms.URLInput).

Like all [`CharField`](#django.db.models.CharField) subclasses, [`URLField`](#django.db.models.URLField) takes the optional
[`max_length`](#django.db.models.CharField.max_length) argument. If you don’t specify
[`max_length`](#django.db.models.CharField.max_length), a default of 200 is used.

### `UUIDField`

### *class* UUIDField(\*\*options)

A field for storing universally unique identifiers. Uses Python’s
[`UUID`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html#uuid.UUID) class. When used on PostgreSQL and MariaDB 10.7+,
this stores in a `uuid` datatype, otherwise in a `char(32)`.

Universally unique identifiers are a good alternative to [`AutoField`](#django.db.models.AutoField) for
[`primary_key`](#django.db.models.Field.primary_key). The database will not generate the UUID for you, so
it is recommended to use [`default`](#django.db.models.Field.default):

```default
import uuid
from django.db import models


class MyUUIDModel(models.Model):
    id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)
    # other fields
```

Note that a callable (with the parentheses omitted) is passed to `default`,
not an instance of `UUID`.

## Relationship fields

Django also defines a set of fields that represent relations.

<a id="ref-foreignkey"></a>

### `ForeignKey`

### *class* ForeignKey(to, on_delete, \*\*options)

A many-to-one relationship. Requires two positional arguments: the class to
which the model is related and the [`on_delete`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey.on_delete) option.

<a id="recursive-relationships"></a>

To create a recursive relationship – an object that has a many-to-one
relationship with itself – use `models.ForeignKey('self',
on_delete=models.CASCADE)`.

<a id="lazy-relationships"></a>

If you need to create a relationship on a model that has not yet been defined,
you can use the name of the model, rather than the model object itself:

```default
from django.db import models


class Car(models.Model):
    manufacturer = models.ForeignKey(
        "Manufacturer",
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
    )
    # ...


class Manufacturer(models.Model):
    # ...
    pass
```

Relationships defined this way on [abstract models](../../topics/db/models.md#abstract-base-classes) are resolved when the model is subclassed as a
concrete model and are not relative to the abstract model’s `app_label`:

```python
from django.db import models


class AbstractCar(models.Model):
    manufacturer = models.ForeignKey("Manufacturer", on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

```python
from django.db import models
from products.models import AbstractCar


class Manufacturer(models.Model):
    pass


class Car(AbstractCar):
    pass


# Car.manufacturer will point to `production.Manufacturer` here.
```

To refer to models defined in another application, you can explicitly specify
a model with the full application label. For example, if the `Manufacturer`
model above is defined in another application called `production`, you’d
need to use:

```default
class Car(models.Model):
    manufacturer = models.ForeignKey(
        "production.Manufacturer",
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
    )
```

This sort of reference, called a lazy relationship, can be useful when
resolving circular import dependencies between two applications.

A database index is automatically created on the `ForeignKey`. You can
disable this by setting [`db_index`](#django.db.models.Field.db_index) to `False`.  You may want to
avoid the overhead of an index if you are creating a foreign key for
consistency rather than joins, or if you will be creating an alternative index
like a partial or multiple column index.

#### Database Representation

Behind the scenes, Django appends `"_id"` to the field name to create its
database column name. In the above example, the database table for the `Car`
model will have a `manufacturer_id` column. (You can change this explicitly by
specifying [`db_column`](#django.db.models.Field.db_column)) However, your code should never have to
deal with the database column name, unless you write custom SQL. You’ll always
deal with the field names of your model object.

<a id="foreign-key-arguments"></a>

#### Arguments

[`ForeignKey`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey) accepts other arguments that define the details of how the
relation works.

#### ForeignKey.on_delete

When an object referenced by a [`ForeignKey`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey) is deleted, Django will
emulate the behavior of the SQL constraint specified by the
[`on_delete`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey.on_delete) argument. For example, if you have a nullable
[`ForeignKey`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey) and you want it to be set null when the referenced
object is deleted:

```default
user = models.ForeignKey(
    User,
    models.SET_NULL,
    blank=True,
    null=True,
)
```

`on_delete` doesn’t create an SQL constraint in the database. Support for
database-level cascade options [may be implemented later](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/21961).

The possible values for [`on_delete`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey.on_delete) are found in
[`django.db.models`](../../topics/db/models.md#module-django.db.models):

* ### CASCADE

  Cascade deletes. Django emulates the behavior of the SQL constraint ON
  DELETE CASCADE and also deletes the object containing the ForeignKey.

  [`Model.delete()`](instances.md#django.db.models.Model.delete) isn’t called on related models, but the
  [`pre_delete`](../signals.md#django.db.models.signals.pre_delete) and
  [`post_delete`](../signals.md#django.db.models.signals.post_delete) signals are sent for all
  deleted objects.
* ### PROTECT

  Prevent deletion of the referenced object by raising
  [`ProtectedError`](../exceptions.md#django.db.models.ProtectedError), a subclass of
  [`django.db.IntegrityError`](../exceptions.md#django.db.IntegrityError).
* ### RESTRICT

  Prevent deletion of the referenced object by raising
  [`RestrictedError`](../exceptions.md#django.db.models.RestrictedError) (a subclass of
  [`django.db.IntegrityError`](../exceptions.md#django.db.IntegrityError)). Unlike [`PROTECT`](#django.db.models.PROTECT), deletion of the
  referenced object is allowed if it also references a different object
  that is being deleted in the same operation, but via a [`CASCADE`](#django.db.models.CASCADE)
  relationship.

  Consider this set of models:
  ```default
  class Artist(models.Model):
      name = models.CharField(max_length=10)


  class Album(models.Model):
      artist = models.ForeignKey(Artist, on_delete=models.CASCADE)


  class Song(models.Model):
      artist = models.ForeignKey(Artist, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
      album = models.ForeignKey(Album, on_delete=models.RESTRICT)
  ```

  `Artist` can be deleted even if that implies deleting an `Album`
  which is referenced by a `Song`, because `Song` also references
  `Artist` itself through a cascading relationship. For example:
  ```pycon
  >>> artist_one = Artist.objects.create(name="artist one")
  >>> artist_two = Artist.objects.create(name="artist two")
  >>> album_one = Album.objects.create(artist=artist_one)
  >>> album_two = Album.objects.create(artist=artist_two)
  >>> song_one = Song.objects.create(artist=artist_one, album=album_one)
  >>> song_two = Song.objects.create(artist=artist_one, album=album_two)
  >>> album_one.delete()
  # Raises RestrictedError.
  >>> artist_two.delete()
  # Raises RestrictedError.
  >>> artist_one.delete()
  (4, {'Song': 2, 'Album': 1, 'Artist': 1})
  ```
* ### SET_NULL

  Set the [`ForeignKey`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey) null; this is only possible if
  [`null`](#django.db.models.Field.null) is `True`.
* ### SET_DEFAULT

  Set the [`ForeignKey`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey) to its default value; a default for the
  [`ForeignKey`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey) must be set.
* ### SET()

  Set the [`ForeignKey`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey) to the value passed to
  [`SET()`](#django.db.models.SET), or if a callable is passed in,
  the result of calling it. In most cases, passing a callable will be
  necessary to avoid executing queries at the time your `models.py` is
  imported:
  ```default
  from django.conf import settings
  from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
  from django.db import models


  def get_sentinel_user():
      return get_user_model().objects.get_or_create(username="deleted")[0]


  class MyModel(models.Model):
      user = models.ForeignKey(
          settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
          on_delete=models.SET(get_sentinel_user),
      )
  ```
* ### DO_NOTHING

  Take no action. If your database backend enforces referential
  integrity, this will cause an [`IntegrityError`](../exceptions.md#django.db.IntegrityError) unless
  you manually add an SQL `ON DELETE` constraint to the database field.

#### ForeignKey.limit_choices_to

Sets a limit to the available choices for this field when this field is
rendered using a `ModelForm` or the admin (by default, all objects
in the queryset are available to choose). Either a dictionary, a
[`Q`](querysets.md#django.db.models.Q) object, or a callable returning a
dictionary or [`Q`](querysets.md#django.db.models.Q) object can be used.

For example:

```default
staff_member = models.ForeignKey(
    User,
    on_delete=models.CASCADE,
    limit_choices_to={"is_staff": True},
)
```

causes the corresponding field on the `ModelForm` to list only `Users`
that have `is_staff=True`. This may be helpful in the Django admin.

The callable form can be helpful, for instance, when used in conjunction
with the Python `datetime` module to limit selections by date range. For
example:

```default
def limit_pub_date_choices():
    return {"pub_date__lte": datetime.date.today()}


limit_choices_to = limit_pub_date_choices
```

If `limit_choices_to` is or returns a [`Q object`](querysets.md#django.db.models.Q), which is useful for [complex queries](../../topics/db/queries.md#complex-lookups-with-q), then it will only have an effect on the choices
available in the admin when the field is not listed in
[`raw_id_fields`](../contrib/admin/index.md#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.raw_id_fields) in the
`ModelAdmin` for the model.

#### NOTE
If a callable is used for `limit_choices_to`, it will be invoked
every time a new form is instantiated. It may also be invoked when a
model is validated, for example by management commands or the admin.
The admin constructs querysets to validate its form inputs in various
edge cases multiple times, so there is a possibility your callable may
be invoked several times.

#### ForeignKey.related_name

The name to use for the relation from the related object back to this one.
It’s also the default value for [`related_query_name`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_query_name) (the name to use
for the reverse filter name from the target model). See the [related
objects documentation](../../topics/db/queries.md#backwards-related-objects) for a full explanation
and example. Note that you must set this value when defining relations on
[abstract models](../../topics/db/models.md#abstract-base-classes); and when you do so
[some special syntax](../../topics/db/models.md#abstract-related-name) is available.

If you’d prefer Django not to create a backwards relation, set
`related_name` to `'+'` or end it with `'+'`. For example, this will
ensure that the `User` model won’t have a backwards relation to this
model:

```default
user = models.ForeignKey(
    User,
    on_delete=models.CASCADE,
    related_name="+",
)
```

#### ForeignKey.related_query_name

The name to use for the reverse filter name from the target model. It
defaults to the value of [`related_name`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name) or
[`default_related_name`](options.md#django.db.models.Options.default_related_name) if set, otherwise it
defaults to the name of the model:

```default
# Declare the ForeignKey with related_query_name
class Tag(models.Model):
    article = models.ForeignKey(
        Article,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        related_name="tags",
        related_query_name="tag",
    )
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)


# That's now the name of the reverse filter
Article.objects.filter(tag__name="important")
```

Like [`related_name`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name), `related_query_name` supports app label and
class interpolation via [some special syntax](../../topics/db/models.md#abstract-related-name).

#### ForeignKey.to_field

The field on the related object that the relation is to. By default, Django
uses the primary key of the related object. If you reference a different
field, that field must have `unique=True`.

#### ForeignKey.db_constraint

Controls whether or not a constraint should be created in the database for
this foreign key. The default is `True`, and that’s almost certainly what
you want; setting this to `False` can be very bad for data integrity.
That said, here are some scenarios where you might want to do this:

* You have legacy data that is not valid.
* You’re sharding your database.

If this is set to `False`, accessing a related object that doesn’t exist
will raise its `DoesNotExist` exception.

#### ForeignKey.swappable

Controls the migration framework’s reaction if this [`ForeignKey`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey)
is pointing at a swappable model. If it is `True` - the default -
then if the [`ForeignKey`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey) is pointing at a model which matches
the current value of `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` (or another swappable
model setting) the relationship will be stored in the migration using
a reference to the setting, not to the model directly.

You only want to override this to be `False` if you are sure your
model should always point toward the swapped-in model - for example,
if it is a profile model designed specifically for your custom user model.

Setting it to `False` does not mean you can reference a swappable model
even if it is swapped out - `False` means that the migrations made
with this ForeignKey will always reference the exact model you specify
(so it will fail hard if the user tries to run with a User model you don’t
support, for example).

If in doubt, leave it to its default of `True`.

### `ManyToManyField`

### *class* ManyToManyField(to, \*\*options)

A many-to-many relationship. Requires a positional argument: the class to
which the model is related, which works exactly the same as it does for
[`ForeignKey`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey), including [recursive](#recursive-relationships) and
[lazy](#lazy-relationships) relationships.

Related objects can be added, removed, or created with the field’s
[`RelatedManager`](relations.md#django.db.models.fields.related.RelatedManager).

#### Database Representation

Behind the scenes, Django creates an intermediary join table to represent the
many-to-many relationship. By default, this table name is generated using the
name of the many-to-many field and the name of the table for the model that
contains it. Since some databases don’t support table names above a certain
length, these table names will be automatically truncated and a uniqueness hash
will be used, e.g. `author_books_9cdf`. You can manually provide the name of
the join table using the [`db_table`](#django.db.models.ManyToManyField.db_table) option.

<a id="manytomany-arguments"></a>

#### Arguments

[`ManyToManyField`](#django.db.models.ManyToManyField) accepts an extra set of arguments – all optional –
that control how the relationship functions.

#### ManyToManyField.related_name

Same as [`ForeignKey.related_name`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name).

#### ManyToManyField.related_query_name

Same as [`ForeignKey.related_query_name`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_query_name).

#### ManyToManyField.limit_choices_to

Same as [`ForeignKey.limit_choices_to`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey.limit_choices_to).

#### ManyToManyField.symmetrical

Only used in the definition of ManyToManyFields on self. Consider the
following model:

```default
from django.db import models


class Person(models.Model):
    friends = models.ManyToManyField("self")
```

When Django processes this model, it identifies that it has a
[`ManyToManyField`](#django.db.models.ManyToManyField) on itself, and as a result, it doesn’t add a
`person_set` attribute to the `Person` class. Instead, the
[`ManyToManyField`](#django.db.models.ManyToManyField) is assumed to be symmetrical – that is, if I am
your friend, then you are my friend.

If you do not want symmetry in many-to-many relationships with `self`, set
[`symmetrical`](#django.db.models.ManyToManyField.symmetrical) to `False`. This will force Django to
add the descriptor for the reverse relationship, allowing
[`ManyToManyField`](#django.db.models.ManyToManyField) relationships to be non-symmetrical.

#### ManyToManyField.through

Django will automatically generate a table to manage many-to-many
relationships. However, if you want to manually specify the intermediary
table, you can use the [`through`](#django.db.models.ManyToManyField.through) option to specify
the Django model that represents the intermediate table that you want to
use.

The most common use for this option is when you want to associate
[extra data with a many-to-many relationship](../../topics/db/models.md#intermediary-manytomany).

#### NOTE
If you don’t want multiple associations between the same instances, add
a [`UniqueConstraint`](constraints.md#django.db.models.UniqueConstraint) including the from and to
fields. Django’s automatically generated many-to-many tables include
such a constraint.

#### NOTE
Recursive relationships using an intermediary model can’t determine the
reverse accessors names, as they would be the same. You need to set a
[`related_name`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name) to at least one of them. If you’d
prefer Django not to create a backwards relation, set `related_name`
to `'+'`.

If you don’t specify an explicit `through` model, there is still an
implicit `through` model class you can use to directly access the table
created to hold the association. It has three fields to link the models.

If the source and target models differ, the following fields are
generated:

* `id`: the primary key of the relation.
* `<containing_model>_id`: the `id` of the model that declares the
  `ManyToManyField`.
* `<other_model>_id`: the `id` of the model that the
  `ManyToManyField` points to.

If the `ManyToManyField` points from and to the same model, the following
fields are generated:

* `id`: the primary key of the relation.
* `from_<model>_id`: the `id` of the instance which points at the
  model (i.e. the source instance).
* `to_<model>_id`: the `id` of the instance to which the relationship
  points (i.e. the target model instance).

This class can be used to query associated records for a given model
instance like a normal model:

```default
Model.m2mfield.through.objects.all()
```

#### ManyToManyField.through_fields

Only used when a custom intermediary model is specified. Django will
normally determine which fields of the intermediary model to use in order
to establish a many-to-many relationship automatically. However,
consider the following models:

```default
from django.db import models


class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)


class Group(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    members = models.ManyToManyField(
        Person,
        through="Membership",
        through_fields=("group", "person"),
    )


class Membership(models.Model):
    group = models.ForeignKey(Group, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    person = models.ForeignKey(Person, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    inviter = models.ForeignKey(
        Person,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        related_name="membership_invites",
    )
    invite_reason = models.CharField(max_length=64)
```

`Membership` has *two* foreign keys to `Person` (`person` and
`inviter`), which makes the relationship ambiguous and Django can’t know
which one to use. In this case, you must explicitly specify which
foreign keys Django should use using `through_fields`, as in the example
above.

`through_fields` accepts a 2-tuple `('field1', 'field2')`, where
`field1` is the name of the foreign key to the model the
[`ManyToManyField`](#django.db.models.ManyToManyField) is defined on (`group` in this case), and
`field2` the name of the foreign key to the target model (`person`
in this case).

When you have more than one foreign key on an intermediary model to any
(or even both) of the models participating in a many-to-many relationship,
you *must* specify `through_fields`. This also applies to
[recursive relationships](#recursive-relationships)
when an intermediary model is used and there are more than two
foreign keys to the model, or you want to explicitly specify which two
Django should use.

#### ManyToManyField.db_table

The name of the table to create for storing the many-to-many data. If this
is not provided, Django will assume a default name based upon the names of:
the table for the model defining the relationship and the name of the field
itself.

#### ManyToManyField.db_constraint

Controls whether or not constraints should be created in the database for
the foreign keys in the intermediary table. The default is `True`, and
that’s almost certainly what you want; setting this to `False` can be
very bad for data integrity. That said, here are some scenarios where you
might want to do this:

* You have legacy data that is not valid.
* You’re sharding your database.

It is an error to pass both `db_constraint` and `through`.

#### ManyToManyField.swappable

Controls the migration framework’s reaction if this [`ManyToManyField`](#django.db.models.ManyToManyField)
is pointing at a swappable model. If it is `True` - the default -
then if the [`ManyToManyField`](#django.db.models.ManyToManyField) is pointing at a model which matches
the current value of `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` (or another swappable
model setting) the relationship will be stored in the migration using
a reference to the setting, not to the model directly.

You only want to override this to be `False` if you are sure your
model should always point toward the swapped-in model - for example,
if it is a profile model designed specifically for your custom user model.

If in doubt, leave it to its default of `True`.

[`ManyToManyField`](#django.db.models.ManyToManyField) does not support [`validators`](#django.db.models.Field.validators).

[`null`](#django.db.models.Field.null) has no effect since there is no way to require a
relationship at the database level.

### `OneToOneField`

### *class* OneToOneField(to, on_delete, parent_link=False, \*\*options)

A one-to-one relationship. Conceptually, this is similar to a
[`ForeignKey`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey) with [`unique=True`](#django.db.models.Field.unique), but the
“reverse” side of the relation will directly return a single object.

This is most useful as the primary key of a model which “extends”
another model in some way; [Multi-table inheritance](../../topics/db/models.md#multi-table-inheritance) is
implemented by adding an implicit one-to-one relation from the child
model to the parent model, for example.

One positional argument is required: the class to which the model will be
related. This works exactly the same as it does for [`ForeignKey`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey),
including all the options regarding [recursive](#recursive-relationships)
and [lazy](#lazy-relationships) relationships.

If you do not specify the [`related_name`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name) argument for the
`OneToOneField`, Django will use the lowercase name of the current model as
default value.

With the following example:

```default
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models


class MySpecialUser(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(
        settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
    )
    supervisor = models.OneToOneField(
        settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        related_name="supervisor_of",
    )
```

your resulting `User` model will have the following attributes:

```pycon
>>> user = User.objects.get(pk=1)
>>> hasattr(user, "myspecialuser")
True
>>> hasattr(user, "supervisor_of")
True
```

A `RelatedObjectDoesNotExist` exception is raised when accessing the reverse
relationship if an entry in the related table doesn’t exist. This is a subclass
of the target model’s [`Model.DoesNotExist`](class.md#django.db.models.Model.DoesNotExist) exception and can be accessed as an
attribute of the reverse accessor. For example, if a user doesn’t have a
supervisor designated by `MySpecialUser`:

```default
try:
    user.supervisor_of
except User.supervisor_of.RelatedObjectDoesNotExist:
    pass
```

<a id="onetoone-arguments"></a>

Additionally, `OneToOneField` accepts all of the extra arguments
accepted by [`ForeignKey`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey), plus one extra argument:

#### OneToOneField.parent_link

When `True` and used in a model which inherits from another
[concrete model](../../glossary.md#term-concrete-model), indicates that this field should be used as the
link back to the parent class, rather than the extra
`OneToOneField` which would normally be implicitly created by
subclassing.

See [One-to-one relationships](../../topics/db/examples/one_to_one.md) for usage
examples of `OneToOneField`.

## Field API reference

### *class* Field

`Field` is an abstract class that represents a database table column.
Django uses fields to create the database table ([`db_type()`](#django.db.models.Field.db_type)), to map
Python types to database ([`get_prep_value()`](#django.db.models.Field.get_prep_value)) and vice-versa
([`from_db_value()`](#django.db.models.Field.from_db_value)).

A field is thus a fundamental piece in different Django APIs, notably,
[`models`](instances.md#django.db.models.Model) and [`querysets`](querysets.md#django.db.models.query.QuerySet).

In models, a field is instantiated as a class attribute and represents a
particular table column, see [Models](../../topics/db/models.md). It has attributes
such as [`null`](#django.db.models.Field.null) and [`unique`](#django.db.models.Field.unique), and methods that Django uses to
map the field value to database-specific values.

A `Field` is a subclass of
[`RegisterLookupMixin`](lookups.md#django.db.models.lookups.RegisterLookupMixin) and thus both
[`Transform`](lookups.md#django.db.models.Transform) and
[`Lookup`](lookups.md#django.db.models.Lookup) can be registered on it to be used
in `QuerySet`s (e.g. `field_name__exact="foo"`). All [built-in
lookups](querysets.md#field-lookups) are registered by default.

All of Django’s built-in fields, such as [`CharField`](#django.db.models.CharField), are particular
implementations of `Field`. If you need a custom field, you can either
subclass any of the built-in fields or write a `Field` from scratch. In
either case, see [How to create custom model fields](../../howto/custom-model-fields.md).

#### description

A verbose description of the field, e.g. for the
[`django.contrib.admindocs`](../contrib/admin/admindocs.md#module-django.contrib.admindocs) application.

The description can be of the form:

```default
description = _("String (up to %(max_length)s)")
```

where the arguments are interpolated from the field’s `__dict__`.

#### descriptor_class

A class implementing the [descriptor protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#descriptors)
that is instantiated and assigned to the model instance attribute. The
constructor must accept a single argument, the `Field` instance.
Overriding this class attribute allows for customizing the get and set
behavior.

To map a `Field` to a database-specific type, Django exposes several
methods:

#### get_internal_type()

Returns a string naming this field for backend specific purposes.
By default, it returns the class name.

See [Emulating built-in field types](../../howto/custom-model-fields.md#emulating-built-in-field-types) for usage in custom fields.

#### db_type(connection)

Returns the database column data type for the [`Field`](#django.db.models.Field), taking
into account the `connection`.

See [Custom database types](../../howto/custom-model-fields.md#custom-database-types) for usage in custom fields.

#### rel_db_type(connection)

Returns the database column data type for fields such as `ForeignKey`
and `OneToOneField` that point to the [`Field`](#django.db.models.Field), taking
into account the `connection`.

See [Custom database types](../../howto/custom-model-fields.md#custom-database-types) for usage in custom fields.

There are three main situations where Django needs to interact with the
database backend and fields:

* when it queries the database (Python value -> database backend value)
* when it loads data from the database (database backend value -> Python
  value)
* when it saves to the database (Python value -> database backend value)

When querying, [`get_db_prep_value()`](#django.db.models.Field.get_db_prep_value) and [`get_prep_value()`](#django.db.models.Field.get_prep_value) are used:

#### get_prep_value(value)

`value` is the current value of the model’s attribute, and the method
should return data in a format that has been prepared for use as a
parameter in a query.

See [Converting Python objects to query values](../../howto/custom-model-fields.md#converting-python-objects-to-query-values) for usage.

#### get_db_prep_value(value, connection, prepared=False)

Converts `value` to a backend-specific value. By default it returns
`value` if `prepared=True` and [`get_prep_value()`](#django.db.models.Field.get_prep_value) if is
`False`.

See [Converting query values to database values](../../howto/custom-model-fields.md#converting-query-values-to-database-values) for usage.

When loading data, [`from_db_value()`](#django.db.models.Field.from_db_value) is used:

#### from_db_value(value, expression, connection)

Converts a value as returned by the database to a Python object. It is
the reverse of [`get_prep_value()`](#django.db.models.Field.get_prep_value).

This method is not used for most built-in fields as the database
backend already returns the correct Python type, or the backend itself
does the conversion.

`expression` is the same as `self`.

See [Converting values to Python objects](../../howto/custom-model-fields.md#converting-values-to-python-objects) for usage.

#### NOTE
For performance reasons, `from_db_value` is not implemented as a
no-op on fields which do not require it (all Django fields).
Consequently you may not call `super` in your definition.

When saving, [`pre_save()`](#django.db.models.Field.pre_save) and [`get_db_prep_save()`](#django.db.models.Field.get_db_prep_save) are used:

#### get_db_prep_save(value, connection)

Same as the [`get_db_prep_value()`](#django.db.models.Field.get_db_prep_value), but called when the field value
must be *saved* to the database. By default returns
[`get_db_prep_value()`](#django.db.models.Field.get_db_prep_value).

#### pre_save(model_instance, add)

Method called prior to [`get_db_prep_save()`](#django.db.models.Field.get_db_prep_save) to prepare the value
before being saved (e.g. for [`DateField.auto_now`](#django.db.models.DateField.auto_now)).

`model_instance` is the instance this field belongs to and `add`
is whether the instance is being saved to the database for the first
time.

It should return the value of the appropriate attribute from
`model_instance` for this field. The attribute name is in
`self.attname` (this is set up by [`Field`](#django.db.models.Field)).

See [Preprocessing values before saving](../../howto/custom-model-fields.md#preprocessing-values-before-saving) for usage.

Fields often receive their values as a different type, either from
serialization or from forms.

#### to_python(value)

Converts the value into the correct Python object. It acts as the
reverse of [`value_to_string()`](#django.db.models.Field.value_to_string), and is also called in
[`clean()`](instances.md#django.db.models.Model.clean).

See [Converting values to Python objects](../../howto/custom-model-fields.md#converting-values-to-python-objects) for usage.

Besides saving to the database, the field also needs to know how to
serialize its value:

#### value_from_object(obj)

Returns the field’s value for the given model instance.

This method is often used by [`value_to_string()`](#django.db.models.Field.value_to_string).

#### value_to_string(obj)

Converts `obj` to a string. Used to serialize the value of the field.

See [Converting field data for serialization](../../howto/custom-model-fields.md#converting-model-field-to-serialization) for usage.

When using [`model forms`](../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#django.forms.ModelForm), the `Field`
needs to know which form field it should be represented by:

#### formfield(form_class=None, choices_form_class=None, \*\*kwargs)

Returns the default [`django.forms.Field`](../forms/fields.md#django.forms.Field) of this field for
[`ModelForm`](../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#django.forms.ModelForm).

By default, if both `form_class` and `choices_form_class` are
`None`, it uses [`CharField`](../forms/fields.md#django.forms.CharField). If the field has
[`choices`](#django.db.models.Field.choices) and `choices_form_class`
isn’t specified, it uses [`TypedChoiceField`](../forms/fields.md#django.forms.TypedChoiceField).

See [Specifying the form field for a model field](../../howto/custom-model-fields.md#specifying-form-field-for-model-field) for usage.

#### deconstruct()

Returns a 4-tuple with enough information to recreate the field:

1. The name of the field on the model.
2. The import path of the field (e.g. `"django.db.models.IntegerField"`).
   This should be the most portable version, so less specific may be better.
3. A list of positional arguments.
4. A dict of keyword arguments.

This method must be added to fields prior to 1.7 to migrate its data
using [Migrations](../../topics/migrations.md).

## Registering and fetching lookups

`Field` implements the [lookup registration API](lookups.md#lookup-registration-api).
The API can be used to customize which lookups are available for a field class
and its instances, and how lookups are fetched from a field.

<a id="model-field-attributes"></a>

# Field attribute reference

Every `Field` instance contains several attributes that allow
introspecting its behavior. Use these attributes instead of `isinstance`
checks when you need to write code that depends on a field’s functionality.
These attributes can be used together with the [Model._meta API](meta.md#model-meta-field-api) to narrow down a search for specific field types.
Custom model fields should implement these flags.

## Attributes for fields

#### Field.auto_created

Boolean flag that indicates if the field was automatically created, such
as the `OneToOneField` used by model inheritance.

#### Field.concrete

Boolean flag that indicates if the field has a database column associated
with it.

#### Field.hidden

Boolean flag that indicates if a field is hidden and should not be returned
by [`Options.get_fields()`](meta.md#django.db.models.options.Options.get_fields) by default. An example is
the reverse field for a [`ForeignKey`](#django.db.models.ForeignKey) with a
`related_name` that starts with `'+'`.

#### Field.is_relation

Boolean flag that indicates if a field contains references to one or
more other models for its functionality (e.g. `ForeignKey`,
`ManyToManyField`, `OneToOneField`, etc.).

#### Field.model

Returns the model on which the field is defined. If a field is defined on
a superclass of a model, `model` will refer to the superclass, not the
class of the instance.

## Attributes for fields with relations

These attributes are used to query for the cardinality and other details of a
relation. These attribute are present on all fields; however, they will only
have boolean values (rather than `None`) if the field is a relation type
([`Field.is_relation=True`](#django.db.models.Field.is_relation)).

#### Field.many_to_many

Boolean flag that is `True` if the field has a many-to-many relation;
`False` otherwise. The only field included with Django where this is
`True` is `ManyToManyField`.

#### Field.many_to_one

Boolean flag that is `True` if the field has a many-to-one relation, such
as a `ForeignKey`; `False` otherwise.

#### Field.one_to_many

Boolean flag that is `True` if the field has a one-to-many relation, such
as a `GenericRelation` or the reverse of a `ForeignKey`; `False`
otherwise.

#### Field.one_to_one

Boolean flag that is `True` if the field has a one-to-one relation, such
as a `OneToOneField`; `False` otherwise.

#### Field.related_model

Points to the model the field relates to. For example, `Author` in
`ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)`. The `related_model` for
a `GenericForeignKey` is always `None`.
