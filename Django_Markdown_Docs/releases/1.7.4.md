# Django 1.7.4 release notes

*January 27, 2015*

Django 1.7.4 fixes several bugs in 1.7.3.

## Bugfixes

* Fixed a migration crash when unapplying `contrib.contenttypes`’s or
  `contrib.auth`’s first migration ([#24075](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24075)).
* Made the migration’s `RenameModel` operation rename `ManyToManyField`
  tables ([#24135](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24135)).
* Fixed a migration crash on MySQL when migrating from a `OneToOneField` to a
  `ForeignKey` ([#24163](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24163)).
* Prevented the `static.serve` view from producing `ResourceWarning`s in
  certain circumstances (security fix regression, [#24193](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24193)).
* Fixed schema check for ManyToManyField to look for internal type instead
  of checking class instance, so you can write custom m2m-like fields with the
  same behavior. ([#24104](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24104)).
