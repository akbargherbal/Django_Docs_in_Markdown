# Django 3.2.4 release notes

*June 2, 2021*

Django 3.2.4 fixes two security issues and several bugs in 3.2.3.

## CVE-2021-33203: Potential directory traversal via `admindocs`

Staff members could use the [`admindocs`](../ref/contrib/admin/admindocs.md#module-django.contrib.admindocs)
`TemplateDetailView` view to check the existence of arbitrary files.
Additionally, if (and only if) the default admindocs templates have been
customized by the developers to also expose the file contents, then not only
the existence but also the file contents would have been exposed.

As a mitigation, path sanitation is now applied and only files within the
template root directories can be loaded.

## CVE-2021-33571: Possible indeterminate SSRF, RFI, and LFI attacks since validators accepted leading zeros in IPv4 addresses

[`URLValidator`](../ref/validators.md#django.core.validators.URLValidator),
[`validate_ipv4_address()`](../ref/validators.md#django.core.validators.validate_ipv4_address), and
[`validate_ipv46_address()`](../ref/validators.md#django.core.validators.validate_ipv46_address) didn’t prohibit leading
zeros in octal literals. If you used such values you could suffer from
indeterminate SSRF, RFI, and LFI attacks.

[`validate_ipv4_address()`](../ref/validators.md#django.core.validators.validate_ipv4_address) and
[`validate_ipv46_address()`](../ref/validators.md#django.core.validators.validate_ipv46_address) validators were not
affected on Python 3.9.5+.

## Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug in Django 3.2 where a final catch-all view in the admin didn’t
  respect the server-provided value of `SCRIPT_NAME` when redirecting
  unauthenticated users to the login page ([#32754](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32754)).
* Fixed a bug in Django 3.2 where a system check would crash on an abstract
  model ([#32733](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32733)).
* Prevented unnecessary initialization of unused caches following a regression
  in Django 3.2 ([#32747](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32747)).
* Fixed a crash in Django 3.2 that could occur when running `mod_wsgi` with
  the recommended settings while the Windows `colorama` library was installed
  ([#32740](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32740)).
* Fixed a bug in Django 3.2 that would trigger the auto-reloader for template
  changes when directory paths were specified with strings ([#32744](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32744)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.2 that caused a crash of auto-reloader with
  `AttributeError`, e.g. inside a `Conda` environment ([#32783](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32783)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.2 that caused a loss of precision for
  operations with `DecimalField` on MySQL ([#32793](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32793)).
