# Django 1.4.5 release notes

*February 20, 2013*

Django 1.4.5 corrects a packaging problem with yesterday’s [1.4.4 release](1.4.4.md).

The release contained stray `.pyc` files that caused “bad magic number”
errors when running with some versions of Python. This releases corrects this,
and also fixes a bad documentation link in the project template `settings.py`
file generated by `manage.py startproject`.
