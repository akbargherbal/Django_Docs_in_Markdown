# Django 3.0.4 release notes

*March 4, 2020*

Django 3.0.4 fixes a security issue and several bugs in 3.0.3.

## CVE-2020-9402: Potential SQL injection via `tolerance` parameter in GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle

GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle were subject to SQL injection,
using a suitably crafted `tolerance`.

## Bugfixes

* Fixed a data loss possibility when using caching from async code
  ([#31253](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31253)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.0 that caused a file response using a
  temporary file to be closed incorrectly ([#31240](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31240)).
* Fixed a data loss possibility in the
  [`select_for_update()`](../ref/models/querysets.md#django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_for_update). When using
  related fields or parent link fields with [Multi-table inheritance](../topics/db/models.md#multi-table-inheritance) in
  the `of` argument, the corresponding models were not locked
  ([#31246](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31246)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.0 that caused misplacing parameters in logged
  SQL queries on Oracle ([#31271](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31271)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.0.3 that caused misplacing parameters of SQL
  queries when subtracting `DateField` or `DateTimeField` expressions on
  MySQL ([#31312](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31312)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.0 that didnâ€™t include subqueries spanning
  multivalued relations in the `GROUP BY` clause ([#31150](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31150)).
