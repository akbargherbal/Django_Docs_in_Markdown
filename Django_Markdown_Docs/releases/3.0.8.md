Django 3.0.8 fixes several bugs in 3.0.7.

## Bugfixes

* Fixed messages of `InvalidCacheKey` exceptions and `CacheKeyWarning`
  warnings raised by cache key validation ([#31654](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31654)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.0.7 that caused a queryset crash when grouping
  by a many-to-one relationship ([#31660](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31660)).

  `filterable` attribute to be used as the right-hand side in queryset
  filters ([#31664](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31664)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.0.2 that caused a migration crash on
  PostgreSQL when adding a foreign key to a model with a namespaced
