# Django 2.2.3 release notes

*July 1, 2019*

Django 2.2.3 fixes a security issue and several bugs in 2.2.2. Also, the latest
string translations from Transifex are incorporated.

## CVE-2019-12781: Incorrect HTTP detection with reverse-proxy connecting via HTTPS

When deployed behind a reverse-proxy connecting to Django via HTTPS,
[`django.http.HttpRequest.scheme`](../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest.scheme) would incorrectly detect client
requests made via HTTP as using HTTPS. This entails incorrect results for
[`is_secure()`](../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest.is_secure), and
[`build_absolute_uri()`](../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest.build_absolute_uri), and that HTTP
requests would not be redirected to HTTPS in accordance with
[`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`](../ref/settings.md#std-setting-SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT).

`HttpRequest.scheme` now respects [`SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`](../ref/settings.md#std-setting-SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER), if it is
configured, and the appropriate header is set on the request, for both HTTP and
HTTPS requests.

If you deploy Django behind a reverse-proxy that forwards HTTP requests, and
that connects to Django via HTTPS, be sure to verify that your application
correctly handles code paths relying on `scheme`, `is_secure()`,
`build_absolute_uri()`, and `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`.

### Bugfixes

* Fixed a regression in Django 2.2 where [`Avg`](../ref/models/querysets.md#django.db.models.Avg),
  [`StdDev`](../ref/models/querysets.md#django.db.models.StdDev), and [`Variance`](../ref/models/querysets.md#django.db.models.Variance)
  crash with `filter` argument ([#30542](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30542)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 2.2.2 where auto-reloader crashes with
  `AttributeError`, e.g. when using `ipdb` ([#30588](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30588)).
