# Django 1.3.3 release notes

*August 1, 2012*

Following Mondayâ€™s security release of [Django 1.3.2](1.3.2.md),
we began receiving reports that one of the fixes applied was breaking Python
2.4 compatibility for Django 1.3. Since Python 2.4 is a supported Python
version for that release series, this release fixes compatibility with
Python 2.4.
