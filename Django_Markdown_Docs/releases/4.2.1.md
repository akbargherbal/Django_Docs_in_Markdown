# Django 4.2.1 release notes

*May 3, 2023*

Django 4.2.1 fixes a security issue with severity “low” and several bugs in
4.2.

## CVE-2023-31047: Potential bypass of validation when uploading multiple files using one form field

Uploading multiple files using one form field has never been supported by
[`forms.FileField`](../ref/forms/fields.md#django.forms.FileField) or [`forms.ImageField`](../ref/forms/fields.md#django.forms.ImageField) as only the last
uploaded file was validated. Unfortunately, [Uploading multiple files](../topics/http/file-uploads.md#uploading-multiple-files)
topic suggested otherwise.

In order to avoid the vulnerability, [`ClearableFileInput`](../ref/forms/widgets.md#django.forms.ClearableFileInput)
and [`FileInput`](../ref/forms/widgets.md#django.forms.FileInput) form widgets now raise `ValueError` when
the `multiple` HTML attribute is set on them. To prevent the exception and
keep the old behavior, set `allow_multiple_selected` to `True`.

For more details on using the new attribute and handling of multiple files
through a single field, see [Uploading multiple files](../topics/http/file-uploads.md#uploading-multiple-files).

## Bugfixes

* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 that caused a crash of `QuerySet.defer()`
  when deferring fields by attribute names ([#34458](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34458)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 that caused a crash of
  [`SearchVector`](../ref/contrib/postgres/search.md#django.contrib.postgres.search.SearchVector) function with `%`
  characters ([#34459](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34459)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 that caused aggregation over query that
  uses explicit grouping to group against the wrong columns ([#34464](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34464)).
* Reallowed, following a regression in Django 4.2, setting the
  `"cursor_factory"` option in [`OPTIONS`](../ref/settings.md#std-setting-OPTIONS) on PostgreSQL
  ([#34466](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34466)).
* Enforced UTF-8 client encoding on PostgreSQL, following a regression in
  Django 4.2 ([#34470](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34470)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 where `i18n_patterns()` didn’t respect the
  `prefix_default_language` argument when a fallback language of the default
  language was used ([#34455](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34455)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 where translated URLs of the default
  language from `i18n_patterns()` with `prefix_default_language` set to
  `False` raised 404 errors for a request with a different language
  ([#34515](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34515)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 where creating copies and deep copies of
  `HttpRequest`, `HttpResponse`, and their subclasses didn’t always work
  correctly ([#34482](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34482), [#34484](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34484)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 where `timesince` and `timeuntil`
  template filters returned incorrect results for a datetime with a non-UTC
  timezone when a time difference is less than 1 day ([#34483](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34483)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 that caused a crash of
  [`SearchHeadline`](../ref/contrib/postgres/search.md#django.contrib.postgres.search.SearchHeadline) function with
  `psycopg` 3 ([#34486](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34486)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 that caused incorrect `ClearableFileInput`
  margins in the admin ([#34506](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34506)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 where breadcrumbs didn’t appear on admin
  site app index views ([#34512](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34512)).
* Made squashing migrations reduce `AddIndex`, `RemoveIndex`,
  `RenameIndex`, and `CreateModel` operations which allows removing a
  deprecated `Meta.index_together` option from historical migrations and use
  `Meta.indexes` instead ([#34525](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34525)).
