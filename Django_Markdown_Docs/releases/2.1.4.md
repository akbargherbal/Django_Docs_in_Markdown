# Django 2.1.4 release notes

*December 3, 2018*

Django 2.1.4 fixes several bugs in 2.1.3.

## Bugfixes

* Corrected the default password list that `CommonPasswordValidator` uses by
  lowercasing all passwords to match the format expected by the validator
  ([#29952](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29952)).
* Prevented repetitive calls to `geos_version_tuple()` in the `WKBWriter`
  class in an attempt to fix a random crash involving `LooseVersion`
  ([#29959](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29959)).
* Fixed keep-alive support in `runserver` after it was disabled to fix
  another issue in Django 2.0 ([#29849](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29849)).
* Fixed admin view-only change form crash when using
  `ModelAdmin.prepopulated_fields` ([#29929](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29929)).
* Fixed “Please correct the errors below” error message when editing an object
  in the admin if the user only has the “view” permission on inlines
  ([#29930](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29930)).
