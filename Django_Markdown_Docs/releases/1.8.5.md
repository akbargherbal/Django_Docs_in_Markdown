# Django 1.8.5 release notes

*October 3, 2015*

Django 1.8.5 fixes several bugs in 1.8.4.

## Bugfixes

* Made the development server’s autoreload more robust ([#24704](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24704)).
* Fixed `AssertionError` in some delete queries with a model containing a
  field that is both a foreign and primary key ([#24951](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24951)).
* Fixed `AssertionError` in some complex queries ([#24525](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24525)).
* Fixed a migrations crash with `GenericForeignKey` ([#25040](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25040)).
* Made `translation.override()` clear the overridden language when a
  translation isn’t initially active ([#25295](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25295)).
* Fixed crash when using a value in `ModelAdmin.list_display` that clashed
  with a reverse field on the model ([#25299](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25299)).
* Fixed autocompletion for options of non-`argparse` management commands
  ([#25372](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25372)).
* Alphabetized ordering of imports in `from django.db import migrations,
  models` statement in newly created migrations ([#25384](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25384)).
* Fixed migrations crash on MySQL when adding a text or a blob field with an
  unhashable default ([#25393](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25393)).
* Changed `Count` queries to execute `COUNT(*)` instead of `COUNT('*')`
  as versions of Django before 1.8 did ([#25377](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25377)). This may fix a
  performance regression on some databases.
* Fixed custom queryset chaining with `values()` and `values_list()`
  ([#20625](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/20625)).
* Moved the [unsaved model instance assignment data loss check](1.8.md#unsaved-model-instance-check-18) on reverse relations to `Model.save()`
  ([#25160](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25160)).
* Readded inline foreign keys to form instances when validating model formsets
  ([#25431](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25431)).
* Allowed using ORM write methods after disabling autocommit with
  [`set_autocommit(False)`](../topics/db/transactions.md#django.db.transaction.set_autocommit)
  ([#24921](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24921)).
* Fixed the `manage.py test --keepdb` option on Oracle ([#25421](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25421)).
* Fixed incorrect queries with multiple many-to-many fields on a model with the
  same ‘to’ model and with `related_name` set to ‘+’ ([#24505](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24505),
  [#25486](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25486)).
* Fixed pickling a `SimpleLazyObject` wrapping a model ([#25389](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25389)).
