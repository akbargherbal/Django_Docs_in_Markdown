# Django 3.0.2 release notes

*January 2, 2020*

Django 3.0.2 fixes several bugs in 3.0.1.

## Bugfixes

* Fixed a regression in Django 3.0 that didnâ€™t include columns referenced by a
  `Subquery()` in the `GROUP BY` clause ([#31094](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31094)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.0 where `QuerySet.exists()` crashed if a
  queryset contained an aggregation over a `Subquery()` ([#31109](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31109)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.0 that caused a migration crash on PostgreSQL
  10+ when adding a foreign key and changing data in the same migration
  ([#31106](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31106)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.0 where loading fixtures crashed for models
  defining a [`default`](../ref/models/fields.md#django.db.models.Field.default) for the primary key
  ([#31071](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31071)).
