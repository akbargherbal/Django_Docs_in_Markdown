# Django 5.0.1 release notes

*January 2, 2024*

Django 5.0.1 fixes several bugs in 5.0.

## Bugfixes

* Reallowed, following a regression in Django 5.0, using a foreign key to a
  model with a primary key that is not `AutoField` in
  [`ModelAdmin.list_filter`](../ref/contrib/admin/index.md#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_filter) ([#35020](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35020)).
* Fixed a long standing bug in handling the `RETURNING INTO` clause that
  caused a crash when creating a model instance with a `GeneratedField` which
  `output_field` had backend-specific converters ([#35024](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35024)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 that caused a crash of `Model.save()` for
  models with both `GeneratedField` and `ForeignKey` fields
  ([#35019](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35019)).
* Fixed a bug in Django 5.0 that caused a migration crash on Oracle < 23c when
  adding a `GeneratedField` with `output_field=BooleanField`
  ([#35018](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35018)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 where admin fields on the same line could
  overflow the page and become non-interactive ([#35012](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35012)).
* Added compatibility for `oracledb` 2.0.0 ([#35054](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35054)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 where querysets referenced incorrect field
  names from `FilteredRelation()` ([#35050](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35050)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 that caused a system check crash when
  `ModelAdmin.filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` contained a reverse
  many-to-many relation with `related_name` ([#35056](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35056)).
