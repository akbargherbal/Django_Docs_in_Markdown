# Django 3.2.1 release notes

*May 4, 2021*

Django 3.2.1 fixes a security issue and several bugs in 3.2.

## CVE-2021-31542: Potential directory-traversal via uploaded files

`MultiPartParser`, `UploadedFile`, and `FieldFile` allowed
directory-traversal via uploaded files with suitably crafted file names.

In order to mitigate this risk, stricter basename and path sanitation is now
applied.

## Bugfixes

* Corrected detection of GDAL 3.2 on Windows ([#32544](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32544)).
* Fixed a bug in Django 3.2 where subclasses of `BigAutoField` and
  `SmallAutoField` were not allowed for the [`DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`](../ref/settings.md#std-setting-DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD)
  setting ([#32620](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32620)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.2 that caused a crash of
  `QuerySet.values()/values_list()` after `QuerySet.union()`,
  `intersection()`, and `difference()` when it was ordered by an
  unannotated field ([#32627](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32627)).
* Restored, following a regression in Django 3.2, displaying an exception
  message on the technical 404 debug page ([#32637](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32637)).
* Fixed a bug in Django 3.2 where a system check would crash on a reverse
  one-to-one relationships in `CheckConstraint.check` or
  `UniqueConstraint.condition` ([#32635](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32635)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.2 that caused a crash of
  [`ModelAdmin.search_fields`](../ref/contrib/admin/index.md#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.search_fields) when searching against phrases with
  unbalanced quotes ([#32649](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32649)).
* Fixed a bug in Django 3.2 where variable lookup errors were logged rendering
  the sitemap template if alternates were not defined ([#32648](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32648)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.2 that caused a crash when combining `Q()`
  objects which contains boolean expressions ([#32548](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32548)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.2 that caused a crash of `QuerySet.update()`
  on a queryset ordered by inherited or joined fields on MySQL and MariaDB
  ([#32645](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32645)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.2 that caused a crash when decoding a cookie
  value, used by `django.contrib.messages.storage.cookie.CookieStorage`, in
  the pre-Django 3.2 format ([#32643](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32643)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.2 that stopped the shift-key modifier
  selecting multiple rows in the admin changelist ([#32647](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32647)).
* Fixed a bug in Django 3.2 where a system check would crash on the
  [`STATICFILES_DIRS`](../ref/settings.md#std-setting-STATICFILES_DIRS) setting with a list of 2-tuples of
  `(prefix, path)` ([#32665](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32665)).
* Fixed a long standing bug involving queryset bitwise combination when used
  with subqueries that began manifesting in Django 3.2, due to a separate fix
  using `Exists` to `exclude()` multi-valued relationships
  ([#32650](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32650)).
* Fixed a bug in Django 3.2 where variable lookup errors were logged when
  rendering some admin templates ([#32681](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32681)).
* Fixed a bug in Django 3.2 where an admin changelist would crash when deleting
  objects filtered against multi-valued relationships ([#32682](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32682)). The
  admin changelist now uses `Exists()` instead of `QuerySet.distinct()`
  because calling `delete()` after `distinct()` is not allowed in Django
  3.2 to address a data loss possibility.
* Fixed a regression in Django 3.2 where the calling process environment would
  not be passed to the `dbshell` command on PostgreSQL ([#32687](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32687)).
* Fixed a performance regression in Django 3.2 when building complex filters
  with subqueries ([#32632](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32632)). As a side-effect the private API to check
  `django.db.sql.query.Query` equality is removed.
