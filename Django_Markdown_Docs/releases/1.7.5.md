# Django 1.7.5 release notes

*February 25, 2015*

Django 1.7.5 fixes several bugs in 1.7.4.

## Bugfixes

* Reverted a fix that prevented a migration crash when unapplying
  `contrib.contenttypes`’s or `contrib.auth`’s first migration
  ([#24075](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24075)) due to severe impact on the test performance
  ([#24251](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24251)) and problems in multi-database setups ([#24298](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24298)).
* Fixed a regression that prevented custom fields inheriting from
  `ManyToManyField` from being recognized in migrations ([#24236](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24236)).
* Fixed crash in `contrib.sites` migrations when a default database isn’t
  used ([#24332](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24332)).
* Added the ability to set the isolation level on PostgreSQL with psycopg2 ≥
  2.4.2 ([#24318](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24318)). It was advertised as a new feature in Django 1.6
  but it didn’t work in practice.
* Formats for the Azerbaijani locale (`az`) have been added.
