# Django 4.1.12 release notes

*October 4, 2023*

Django 4.1.12 fixes a security issue with severity “moderate” in 4.1.11.

## CVE-2023-43665: Denial-of-service possibility in `django.utils.text.Truncator`

Following the fix for [CVE-2019-14232](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14232), the regular expressions used in the
implementation of `django.utils.text.Truncator`’s `chars()` and `words()`
methods (with `html=True`) were revised and improved. However, these regular
expressions still exhibited linear backtracking complexity, so when given a
very long, potentially malformed HTML input, the evaluation would still be
slow, leading to a potential denial of service vulnerability.

The `chars()` and `words()` methods are used to implement the
[`truncatechars_html`](../ref/templates/builtins.md#std-templatefilter-truncatechars_html) and [`truncatewords_html`](../ref/templates/builtins.md#std-templatefilter-truncatewords_html) template
filters, which were thus also vulnerable.

The input processed by `Truncator`, when operating in HTML mode, has been
limited to the first five million characters in order to avoid potential
performance and memory issues.
