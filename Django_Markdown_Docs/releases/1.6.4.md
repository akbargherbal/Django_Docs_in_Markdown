# Django 1.6.4 release notes

*April 28, 2014*

Django 1.6.4 fixes several bugs in 1.6.3.

## Bugfixes

* Added backwards compatibility support for the [`django.contrib.messages`](../ref/contrib/messages.md#module-django.contrib.messages)
  cookie format of Django 1.4 and earlier to facilitate upgrading to 1.6 from
  1.4 ([#22426](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/22426)).
* Restored the ability to `reverse()` views created using
  [`functools.partial()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial) ([#22486](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/22486)).
* Fixed the `object_id` of the `LogEntry` thatâ€™s created after a user
  password change in the admin ([#22515](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/22515)).
