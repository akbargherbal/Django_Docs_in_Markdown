# Django 1.8.6 release notes

*November 4, 2015*

Django 1.8.6 adds official support for Python 3.5 and fixes several bugs in
1.8.5.

## Bugfixes

* Fixed a regression causing `ModelChoiceField` to ignore
  `prefetch_related()` on its queryset ([#25496](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25496)).
* Allowed “mode=memory” in SQLite test database name if supported
  ([#12118](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/12118)).
* Fixed system check crash on `ForeignKey` to abstract model
  ([#25503](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25503)).
* Fixed incorrect queries when you have multiple `ManyToManyField`s on
  different models that have the same field name, point to the same model, and
  have their reverse relations disabled ([#25545](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25545)).
* Allowed filtering over a `RawSQL` annotation ([#25506](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25506)).
* Made the `Concat` database function idempotent on SQLite ([#25517](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25517)).
* Avoided a confusing stack trace when starting [`runserver`](../ref/django-admin.md#django-admin-runserver) with an
  invalid [`INSTALLED_APPS`](../ref/settings.md#std-setting-INSTALLED_APPS) setting ([#25510](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25510)). This regression
  appeared in 1.8.5 as a side effect of fixing [#24704](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24704).
* Made deferred models use their proxied model’s `_meta.apps` for caching
  and retrieval ([#25563](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25563)). This prevents any models generated in data
  migrations using `QuerySet.defer()` from leaking to test and application
  code.
* Fixed a typo in the name of the `strictly_above` PostGIS lookup
  ([#25592](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25592)).
* Fixed crash with `contrib.postgres.forms.SplitArrayField` and
  `IntegerField` on invalid value ([#25597](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25597)).
* Added a helpful error message when Django and South migrations exist in the
  same directory ([#25618](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25618)).
* Fixed a regression in `URLValidator` that allowed URLs with consecutive
  dots in the domain section (like `http://example..com/`) to pass
  ([#25620](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25620)).
* Fixed a crash with `GenericRelation` and
  `BaseModelAdmin.to_field_allowed` ([#25622](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25622)).
