# Django 1.11.27 release notes

*December 18, 2019*

Django 1.11.27 fixes a security issue and a data loss bug in 1.11.26.

## CVE-2019-19844: Potential account hijack via password reset form

By submitting a suitably crafted email address making use of Unicode
characters, that compared equal to an existing user email when lower-cased for
comparison, an attacker could be sent a password reset token for the matched
account.

In order to avoid this vulnerability, password reset requests now compare the
submitted email using the stricter, recommended algorithm for case-insensitive
comparison of two identifiers from [Unicode Technical Report 36, section
2.11.2(B)(2)](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr36/#Recommendations_General). Upon a match, the email containing the reset token will be
sent to the email address on record rather than the submitted address.

## Bugfixes

* Fixed a data loss possibility in
  [`SplitArrayField`](../ref/contrib/postgres/forms.md#django.contrib.postgres.forms.SplitArrayField). When using with
  `ArrayField(BooleanField())`, all values after the first `True` value
  were marked as checked instead of preserving passed values ([#31073](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31073)).
