# Django 4.0.2 release notes

*February 1, 2022*

Django 4.0.2 fixes two security issues with severity “medium” and several bugs
in 4.0.1. Also, the latest string translations from Transifex are incorporated,
with a special mention for Bulgarian (fully translated).

## CVE-2022-22818: Possible XSS via `{% debug %}` template tag

The `{% debug %}` template tag didn’t properly encode the current context,
posing an XSS attack vector.

In order to avoid this vulnerability, `{% debug %}` no longer outputs
information when the `DEBUG` setting is `False`, and it ensures all context
variables are correctly escaped when the `DEBUG` setting is `True`.

## CVE-2022-23833: Denial-of-service possibility in file uploads

Passing certain inputs to multipart forms could result in an infinite loop when
parsing files.
