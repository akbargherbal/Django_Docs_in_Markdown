## CVE-2022-41323: Potential denial-of-service vulnerability in internationalized URLs

Internationalized URLs were subject to potential denial of service attack via
the locale parameter.

## Bugfixes

* Fixed a regression in Django 4.1 that caused a migration crash on PostgreSQL
  when adding a model with `ExclusionConstraint` ([#33982](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/33982)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 4.1 that caused aggregation over a queryset that
  contained an `Exists` annotation to crash due to too many selected columns
  ([#33992](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/33992)).
* Fixed a bug in Django 4.1 that caused an incorrect validation of
  `CheckConstraint` on `NULL` values ([#33996](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/33996)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 4.1 that caused a
  `QuerySet.values()/values_list()` crash on `ArrayAgg()` and
  `JSONBAgg()` ([#34016](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34016)).
* Fixed a bug in Django 4.1 that caused [`ModelAdmin.autocomplete_fields`](../ref/contrib/admin/index.md#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.autocomplete_fields)
  to be incorrectly selected after adding/changing related instances via popups
  ([#34025](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34025)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 4.1 where the app registry was not populated
  when running parallel tests with the `multiprocessing` start method
  `spawn` ([#34010](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34010)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 4.1 where the `--debug-mode` argument to
  `test` did not work when running parallel tests with the
  `multiprocessing` start method `spawn` ([#34010](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34010)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 4.1 that didn’t alter a sequence type when
  altering type of pre-Django 4.1 serial columns on PostgreSQL
  ([#34058](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34058)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 4.1 that caused a crash for [`View`](../ref/class-based-views/flattened-index.md#View)
  subclasses with asynchronous handlers when handling non-allowed HTTP methods
  ([#34062](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34062)).
* Reverted caching related managers for `ForeignKey`, `ManyToManyField`,
  and `GenericRelation` that caused the incorrect refreshing of related
  objects ([#33984](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/33984)).

  multiple template tag modules to a warning ([#32987](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32987)).
