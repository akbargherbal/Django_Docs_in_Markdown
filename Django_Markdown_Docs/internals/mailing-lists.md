# Mailing lists and Forum

## Django Forum

Django has an [official Forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com) where you can input and ask questions.

There are several categories of discussion including:

* [Using Django](https://forum.djangoproject.com/c/users/6): to ask any question regarding the installation, usage, or
  debugging of Django.
* [Internals](https://forum.djangoproject.com/c/internals/5): for discussion of the development of Django itself.

In addition, Django has several official mailing lists on Google Groups that
are open to anyone.

## `django-users`

#### NOTE

venue for asking usage questions.

This is the right place if you are looking to ask any question regarding the
installation, usage, or debugging of Django.

If it’s the first time you send an email to this list, your email must be
accepted first so don’t worry if [your message does not appear](../faq/help.md#message-does-not-appear-on-django-users) instantly.
