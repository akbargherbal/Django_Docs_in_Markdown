# Django Documentation in Markdown

This repository contains the Django documentation converted from reStructuredText (RST) to Markdown format. The conversion was done to make the documentation more accessible and easier to read on GitHub and other Markdown-friendly platforms.

## Contents

This repository includes Markdown versions of the official Django documentation, maintaining the original structure and content as much as possible.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this project are:

1. To provide an alternative format for reading Django documentation.
2. To make it easier for contributors to suggest edits and improvements to the docs.
3. To allow for better integration with Markdown-based documentation systems.

## How to Use

You can browse the documentation directly on GitHub, or clone this repository to your local machine for offline reading.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/django-docs-markdown.git
cd django-docs-markdown
```

## Conversion Process

The documentation was converted from RST to Markdown using a custom Python script utilizing the `sphinx-markdown-builder` package. While we've made efforts to ensure accuracy, some formatting issues may persist due to differences between RST and Markdown.
